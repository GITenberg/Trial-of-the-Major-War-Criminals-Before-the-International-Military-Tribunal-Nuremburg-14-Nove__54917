<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE (Deputy Chief Prosecutor for the
United Kingdom): If the Tribunal please, when the Tribunal
adjourned I had just dealt with the last of the two Norway documents,
which I how put in as Exhibits GB-140 and GB-141. Their
numbers are 004-PS and D-629.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, for convenience the first document, to which I shall
refer in a few minutes, will be Document Number 1871-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT (Lord Justice Sir Geoffrey Lawrence): I have
that here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, before I come to that,
I just want to say one word about the aggression against the Low
Countries—Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The facts as to the aggression against these countries, during
the period when this defendant was Foreign Minister, were stated
in full by my friend Mr. Roberts, and I think if I give the Tribunal
the reference to the transcript at Pages 1100 to 1125 (Volume III,
Pages 289 to 307), I do not need to detain the Tribunal on that
part of the case. I only remind the Tribunal that the action of
this defendant as Foreign Minister to which attention may be
called is the making of a statement on the 10th of May 1940 to
representatives of the foreign press with regard to the reasons
for the German invasion of the Low Countries; and these reasons
were, in my respectful submission, demonstrated to be false by
the evidence called by Mr. Roberts, which appears in that part
of the transcript.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I then proceed to the aggression in southeastern
Europe against Greece and Yugoslavia, and the first moment of
time in that regard is the meeting at Salzburg in August 1939,
at which the Defendant Von Ribbentrop participated, when Hitler
announced that the Axis had decided to liquidate certain neutrals.
That is Document 1871-PS, which I now put in as Exhibit GB-142,
and the passage to which I should like to refer the Tribunal is
on Page 2 of the English version, two-thirds down the page in
the middle of the fifth paragraph, six lines from the top. Your
Lordship will find the words “Generally speaking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I desire to quote from there:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Generally speaking, it would be best to liquidate the pseudo-neutrals
one after the other. This is fairly easily done if
one Axis partner protects the rear of the other, as the latter
finishes off one of the uncertain neutrals. Italy may consider
Yugoslavia such an uncertain neutral. At the visit of Prince
Regent Paul he (the Führer) suggested, particularly with
regard to Italy, that Prince Paul clarify his political attitude
towards the Axis by a gesture. He had thought of a closer
connection with the Axis and the withdrawal of Yugoslavia
from the League of Nations. Prince Paul agreed to the latter.
Recently the Prince Regent was in London and sought reassurance
from the Western Powers. The same thing was
repeated that happened in the case of Gafencu, who was
also very reasonable during his visit to Germany and who
denied any interest in the aims of the Western Democracies.
Afterwards it was learned that he had later assumed a
contrary standpoint in England. Among the Balkan countries
the Axis can completely rely only on Bulgaria, which is, in
a sense, a natural ally of Italy and Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then missing a sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At the moment of a turn for the worse for Germany and
Italy, however, Yugoslavia would join the other side openly,
hoping thereby to give matters a final turn to the disadvantage
of the Axis.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That demonstrates the policy with regard to uncertain neutrals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as early as September 1940 this defendant reviewed the
war situation with Mussolini. This defendant emphasized the
heavy revenge bombing raids in England and the fact that London
would soon be in ruins. It was agreed between the parties that
only Italian interests were involved in Greece and Yugoslavia and
that Italy could count on German support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Von Ribbentrop went on further to explain to Mussolini
the Spanish plan for the attack on Gibraltar and Germany’s participation
therein and that he was expecting to sign the protocol
with Spain, bringing the latter country into the war, on his return
to Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is Document 1842-PS, which is the next document in the
book to the one at which the Tribunal has just been looking, and
the passage with regard to Greece and Yugoslavia occurs in the
middle of the first page—if I might just read a very short extract:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“With regard to Greece and Yugoslavia the Foreign Minister
stressed that it was exclusively a question of Italian interests,
the settling of which was a matter for Italy alone and
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
in which Italy would be certain of Germany’s sympathetic
assistance.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I don’t think I need trouble the Tribunal with the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Francis Biddle, member for the United
States): I think you had better read the next paragraph.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: “But it seemed to us to be
better not to touch on these problems for the time being,
but instead to concentrate on the destruction of England with
all our forces. Where Germany was concerned, she was
interested in the northern German districts (Norway, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>),
and this was acknowledged by the Duce.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I am very grateful to you, Your Honor. That I put in as Exhibit
GB-143.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A month or two later, in January 1941, at the meeting between
Hitler and Mussolini, in which this defendant participated,
the Greek operation was discussed. Hitler had stated that the
German troops in Romania were for use in the planned campaign
against Greece. That document is C-134, which was put in as
Exhibit GB-119, and therefore I do not propose to give it again
but to give the Tribunal the reference to the points which are
mentioned at the foot of Page 3 of the English text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to that meeting there is a cross-reference in Count
Ciano’s diary, Count Ciano having attended as Italian Foreign
Minister, and he recalls his impression of that meeting in the
diary for the 20th and 21st of January by saying:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Duce is pleased with the conversation on the whole.
I am less pleased. Above all, because Ribbentrop, who had
always been so boastful in the past, told me, when I asked
him outright how long the war would last, that he saw no
possibility of its ending before 1942.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Despite that somewhat pessimistic statement to Count Ciano,
a short time later, 3 weeks later, when it was a question of encouraging
the Japanese, this defendant took a more optimistic line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 13th of February 1941 he saw Ambassador Oshima, the
Japanese Ambassador, and that conversation appears in Document
1834-PS, which is Exhibit USA-129. That was read previously,
and again I simply give the reference on Page 3 of the English
version.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second from the last paragraph dealt with the optimistic
account of the military position and the position of Bulgaria and
Turkey. I do not think I need read it further, but I will give the
Tribunal the reference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then after that, in March, this defendant put forth his efforts
to get Yugoslavia to join the Axis, and on the 25th of March the
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
defendant, in a note to the Prime Minister Cvetković—and this is
Document 2450-PS, which is Exhibit GB-123—gave the assurance:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Axis-Power Governments, during this war, will not
direct a demand to Yugoslavia to permit the march or
transportation of troops through the Yugoslav state or territory.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After that, it is only fair to point out that there was the <span class='it'>coup
d’état</span> in Yugoslavia. General Simovic took over the government;
and two days after the assurance which I just read, at the meeting
of the 27th of March 1941, at which this defendant was present,
Hitler outlined the military campaign against Yugoslavia and
promised the destruction of Yugoslavia and the demolition of
Belgrade by the German Air Force. That is contained in Document
1746-PS, which is Exhibit GB-120; and that was read by my friend,
Colonel Phillimore at an earlier stage so I do not need to read
it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The final action of this defendant with regard to Yugoslavia
was that after the invasion of Yugoslavia Von Ribbentrop was one
of the persons directed by Hitler to draw up the boundaries for
the partition and division of Yugoslavia. The preliminary directive
for that is Document 1195-PS, which I now put in as Exhibit
GB-144.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now come to the aggression against the Soviet Union, and
the first.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Has that been read, 1195?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: No, it has not. I am much
obliged, Your Lordship. I will now read the relevant sentence with
regard to this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 2, Section 2, Your Lordship will see the words “the
drawing up of boundaries.” And in Paragraph 1 it says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Insofar as the drawing up of boundaries has not been laid
down in the above Part I, it will be carried out by the
Supreme Command of the Armed Forces in agreement with
the Foreign Office,”—that is this defendant—“the Delegate
for the Four Year Plan,”—the Defendant Göring—“and the
Reich Minister of the Interior.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Who is the Reich Minister of the Interior?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I think the Defendant Frick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I think it is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, I am grateful to Your
Lordship. I had forgotten that had not been read before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now then, as I say, we come to the aggression against the
Soviet Union; and the first document which has not been put in
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
so far, which I now put in as Exhibit GB-145, is TC-25, the German-Soviet
Non-aggression Pact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 23 August 1939 this defendant had signed the German-Soviet
Non-aggression Pact. Now the first point at which this
defendant seems to have considered special problems of aggression
against the Soviet Union was just after the 20th of April 1941,
when the Defendant Rosenberg and this defendant met or communicated
to consider the problems which were expected to arise
in Occupied Eastern Territory. This defendant appointed his
Counselor, Grosskopf, to be his liaison man with Rosenberg and
also assigned a consul general called Bräutigam, who had many
years experience in the U.S.S.R., as collaborator with Rosenberg.
That is shown in Document 1039-PS, which is already Exhibit
USA-146. I did not propose to read it again, as it had been read.
But the passage to which I have referred is the first paragraph
on the top of Page 2, beginning, “After notification to the Reich
Foreign Minister.” It is that paragraph which I have just mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was in April 1941. The following month, on 18 May 1941,
the German Foreign Office prepared a declaration setting forth
operational zones in the Arctic Ocean, the Baltic and the Black
Seas, to be used by the German Navy and the Air Force in the
coming invasion of the Soviet Union. That is the next document,
C-77, which I now put in as Exhibit GB-146, and it is very short.
Therefore I think I should quote it; it has not been read before:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Foreign Office has prepared for the use in ‘Barbarossa’
the attached draft of a declaration of operational zones. The
Foreign Office, however, has reserved the decision as to the
date when the declaration will be issued as well as the discussion
of particulars.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These last two documents show quite clearly that this defendant
was again implicated in the preparation for this act of aggression.
Then, on the 22d of June 1941, this defendant announced to the
world that the German armies were invading the U.S.S.R., as was
seen by the Tribunal in the film shown on the 11th of December.
And how untrue were the reasons given is shown by the report
of his own Ambassador in Moscow who said that everything was
being done to avoid a conflict. The Tribunal will find the reference
to that in the speech of my learned friend, the Attorney General,
the transcript at Page 888 (Volume III, Page 143).</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now come to the aggression which involved Japan and was
directed against the United States of America. And there the
initial document is 2508-PS, which I now put in as Exhibit GB-147.
That shows that on the 25th of November 1936, as a result
of negotiations of this defendant as Ambassador-at-large, Germany
and Japan had signed the Anticomintern Pact. I do not think
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
that has been read, but if I might just read the introduction, the
recital that gives the purposes of the agreement:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Government of the German Reich and the Imperial
Japanese Government, recognizing that the aim of the Communist
International, known as the Comintern, is to disintegrate
and subdue existing states by all the means at its
command, convinced that the toleration of interference by
the Communist International in the internal affairs of
the nations not only endangers their internal peace and
social well-being but is also a menace to the peace of the
world, desirous of co-operating in the defense against Communist
subversive activities, have agreed as follows.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then there follow the effective terms of the agreement
under which they will act together for 5 years. It is signed by
this defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 27th of September 1940 this defendant, as Foreign
Minister, signed the Tripartite Pact with Japan and Italy, thereby
bringing about a full-scale military and economic alliance for the
creation of a “New Order” in Europe and East Asia. That is
2643-PS, Exhibit USA-149, and has been read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, on the 13th of February of 1941—that is a month or two
later—this defendant was urging the Japanese to attack British
possessions in the Far East. And that is shown in Document 1834-PS,
which is Exhibit USA-129 and which has already been read by
my friend, Mr. Alderman. That was February.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in April of 1941, at a meeting between Hitler and
Matsuoka, representing Japan, at which this defendant was present,
Hitler promised that Germany would declare war on the United
States in the event of war occurring between Japan and the United
States as a result of Japanese aggression in the Pacific. That is
shown in Document 1881-PS, Exhibit USA-33, which has already
been read and which I did not intend to read again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the next document which reinforces that point is 1882-PS,
which is Exhibit USA-153. If I might trouble the Tribunal with
just two short paragraphs of that; it is interesting, showing the
psychological development of this defendant and his views at that
time. They are the first two paragraphs that are quoted, under
the heading “Pages 2 and 3,” where it begins “Matsuoka”; it is
on the first page of the document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Matsuoka then spoke of the general high morale in Germany,
referring to the happy faces he had seen everywhere
among the workers during his recent visit to the Borsig
works. He expressed his regret that developments in Japan
were not yet as far advanced as in Germany and that in his
country the intellectuals still exercised considerable influence.</p>
<hr class='tbk102'/>
<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
“The Reich Foreign Minister replied that at best a nation
which had realized its every ambition could afford the luxury
of intellectuals, some of whom are parasites, anyway.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is “most,” according to my document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Oh, “most”; I beg Your Lordship’s
pardon, it is completely my fault, it should be “most,” “most
of whom are parasites, anyway.”</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“A nation, however, which has to fight for a place in the sun
must give them up. The intellectuals ruined France; in
Germany they had already started their pernicious activities
when National Socialism put a stop to these doings; they
will surely be the cause of the downfall of Britain, which
is to be expected with certainty.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then it continues on the usual lines. That last document was
on the 5th of April.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, the next stage: Within a month after the German Armies
invaded the Soviet Union, the 22d of June 1941, Ribbentrop was
urging his Ambassador in Tokyo to do his utmost to cause the
Japanese Government to attack the Soviet in Siberia; and that is
proved by two documents which have already been put in—2896-PS,
which is Exhibit USA-155, a telegram to the German Ambassador,
in Tokyo, one Ott; and 2897-PS, USA-156, which is the reply from
Ambassador Ott. Both of these were read by my friend, Mr. Alderman,
and I won’t trouble the Tribunal again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the next document, which is D-656, is a new document
which I put in as GB-148. That was captured from the Japanese,
and it is a message—intercepted—which was sent by the Japanese
Ambassador in Berlin just before the attack on the United States.
If I might just read one short extract from this defendant’s speech;
on the 29th of November 1941, that is roughly a week before Pearl
Harbor, this defendant was saying—it is in Paragraph 1, and I will
read it all because it is new:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Ribbentrop opened our meeting by again inquiring whether
I had received any reports regarding the Japanese-United
States negotiations. I replied that I had received no official
word.</p>
<hr class='tbk103'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Ribbentrop: ‘It is essential that Japan effect the New Order
in East Asia without losing this opportunity. There never has
been and probably never will be a time when closer co-operation
under the Tripartite Pact is so important. If Japan
hesitates at this time and Germany goes ahead and establishes
her European New Order, all the military might of Britain
and the United States will be concentrated against Japan.
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk104'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘As Führer Hitler said today, there are fundamental differences
in the very right to exist between Germany and Japan,
and the United States. We have received advice to the effect
that there is practically no hope of the Japanese-United States
negotiations being concluded successfully because of the fact
that the United States is putting up a stiff front.</p>
<hr class='tbk105'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘If this is indeed the fact of the case and if Japan reaches
a decision to fight Britain and the United States, I am confident
that will not only be to the interest of Germany
and Japan jointly but would bring about favorable results for
Japan herself.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Ambassador replied:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“ ‘I can make no definite statement as I am not aware of any
concrete intentions of Japan. Is Your Excellency indicating
that a state of actual war is to be established between Germany
and the United States?’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Ribbentrop:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“ ‘Roosevelt’s a fanatic, so it is impossible to tell what he
would do.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Concerning this point, in view of the fact that Ribbentrop
has said in the past that the United States would undoubtedly
try to avoid meeting German troops, and from the tone of
Hitler’s recent speech as well as that of Ribbentrop’s, I feel
that the German attitude toward the United States is being
considerably stiffened. There are indications at present that
Germany would not refuse to fight the United States if
necessary.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then the next part, Section 2, is an extremely optimistic prognosis
of the war against the Soviet Union. I do not think, in view
of the date in which we are reading it, that I need trouble the
Tribunal with that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are then a few remarks about the intended landing operations
against England, which is also <span class='it'>vieux jeu</span> at this time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Tribunal would go to Part 3, there again we get the international
attitude of mind of this defendant—at the foot of Page 2,
Part 3; and I am quoting:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“ ‘In any event Germany has absolutely no intention of
entering into any peace with England. We are determined to
remove all British influence from Europe. Therefore, at the
end of this war, England will have no influence whatsoever
in international affairs. The island empire of Britain may
remain, but all of her other possessions throughout the world
will probably be divided three ways by Germany, the United
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>
States and Japan. In Africa, Germany will be satisfied with,
roughly, those parts which were formerly German colonies.
Italy will be given the greater share of the African colonies.
Germany desires, above all else, to control European Russia.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And after hearing this defendant, the Ambassador said; and I
quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“ ‘I am fully aware of the fact that Germany’s war campaign
is progressing according to schedule smoothly. However,
suppose that Germany is faced with the situation of having
not only Great Britain as an actual enemy but also all of
those areas in which Britain has influence, and those countries
which have been aiding Britain as actual enemies, as well.
Under such circumstances, the war area will undergo considerable
expansion, of course. What is your opinion of the
outcome of the war under such an eventuality?’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Ribbentrop:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“ ‘We would like to end this war during next year.’ ”—that is,
1942—“ ‘However, under certain circumstances it is possible
that it will have to be continued into the following year.</p>
<hr class='tbk106'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘Should Japan become engaged in a war against the United
States.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are going a little bit too fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: If Your Lordship pleases, I am
sorry. I will go back to the paragraph I have just finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Ribbentrop—and I am still quoting:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“ ‘We would like to end this war during next year. However,
under certain circumstances it is possible that it will have to
be continued into the following year.</p>
<hr class='tbk107'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘Should Japan become engaged in a war against the United
States, Germany, of course, would join the war immediately.
There is absolutely no possibility of Germany’s entering into
a separate peace with the United States under such circumstances.
The Führer is determined on that point.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That document associates this defendant with the aggression by
Japan against the United States in the closest possible way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another new document, which is also an intercepted Japanese
diplomatic message, is the next one, D-657, which I put in as Exhibit
GB-149; and if I might read the first two sentences that show what
it is—and I quote—the Japanese Ambassador says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At 1:00 p. m. today”—the 8th of December—“I called on
Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and told him our wish was to
have Germany and Italy issue formal declarations of war on
America at once. Ribbentrop replied that Hitler was then in
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
the midst of a conference at general headquarters, discussing
how the formalities of declaring war could be carried out so
as to make a good impression on the German people, and that
he would transmit your wish to him at once and do whatever
he could to have it carried out promptly. At that time Ribbentrop
told me that on the morning of the 8th”—that is before
the declaration of war—“Hitler issued orders to the entire
German Navy to attack American ships whenever and wherever
they might meet them.</p>
<hr class='tbk108'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It goes without saying that this is only for your secret information.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as a matter of fact, as the Tribunal are aware, on the 11th
of December 1941 this Defendant Ribbentrop, in the name of the
German Government, announced a state of war between Germany
and the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next stage concerns his attempt to get Japan to attack the
Soviet Union.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Ribbentrop’s conversations with Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador,
in July 1942 and in March and April 1943, he continued
to urge Japanese participation and aggression against the Soviet
Union. This is shown in Document 2911-PS, which has been put in
as Exhibit USA-157 and already read, and Document 2954-PS, which
I now put in as GB-150. That is a new document; and if I might
just indicate the effect of it by a very short quotation—it is a discussion
between the Defendant Ribbentrop and Ambassador Oshima.
It begins:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Ambassador Oshima declared that he has received a telegram
from Tokyo; and he is to report, by order of his Government,
to the Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs the following:</p>
<hr class='tbk109'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The suggestion of the German Government to attack Russia
was the object of a common conference between the Japanese
Government and the Imperial headquarters, during which the
question was discussed in detail and investigated exactly. The
outcome is the following: The Japanese Government thoroughly
recognize the danger which threatens from Russia and completely
understand the desire of their German ally that Japan
on her part also enter the war against Russia. However, it is
not possible for the Japanese Government, considering the
present war situation, to enter the war. They are rather of
the conviction that it would be in the common interest not to
start the war against Russia now. On the other hand, the
Japanese Government will never lose sight of the Russian
question.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, in the middle of the next paragraph, this defendant
returns to the attack. The third sentence—it begins on the fourth
line—says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“However, it would be more correct that all powers allied in
the Three Power Pact, would combine their forces to strike
together at not only England and America, but also Russia. It
is not good if one part must fight alone.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then the pressure on Japan to attack Russia is shown again in
the next document, 2929-PS, which was put in as Exhibit USA-159.
And, if I might just close this part of the case, if I might read that—it
is very short:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs then stressed again
that without any doubt this year presented the most favorable
opportunity for Japan, if she felt strong enough and had
sufficient antitank weapons at her disposal to attack Russia,
which certainly would never again be as weak as at the
moment”—the moment being 18 April 1943.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>If the Tribunal please, that concludes my evidence on the second
allegation dealing with aggressive war; and I submit that that allegation
in the Indictment is more than amply proved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third allegation is that the Defendant Ribbentrop authorized,
directed, and participated in War Crimes and Crimes against
Humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, I am considering this from the point of view of
planning these crimes only. The execution of the crimes will be
dealt with by my friends and Soviet colleagues, but it is relevant
to show how this defendant participated in the planning of such
crimes. I deal, first, with the killing of Allied aviators; secondly,
with the destruction of peoples in Europe; and thirdly, with the
persecution of the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, the killing of Allied aviators:</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the increasing air raids on German cities in 1944 by Allied
Air Forces, the German Government proposed to undertake a plan
to deter Anglo-American fliers from further raids on the Reich cities.
In a report of a meeting at which a definite policy was to be established,
there is stated what was the point of view that this Defendant
Ribbentrop had been urging. That is in Document 735-PS, which
I now put in as Exhibit GB-151. That is a discussion of a meeting
at the Führer’s headquarters on the 6th of June 1944. If I might
read the first paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Obergruppenführer Kaltenbrunner informed the Deputy
Chief of Operations Staff”—WFSt—“in Klessheim on the
afternoon of the 6th of June that a conference on this question
had been held shortly before by the Reich Marshal”—the
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
Defendant Göring—“the Reich Foreign Minister”—the Defendant
Von Ribbentrop—“and the Reichsführer SS.”—Himmler—“Contrary
to the original suggestion made by the Reich
Foreign Minister, who wished to include every type of terror
attack on the German civilian population, including bombing
attacks on cities, it was agreed in the above conference that
merely those attacks carried out with aircraft armament aimed
directly at the civilian population and their property should
be taken as the standard for the evidence of a criminal action
in this sense. Lynch law would have to be the rule, there was
no mention of trial by court-martial or handing over to the
police.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is, this defendant was pressing that even where there was
an attack on a German city, the airmen should be handed over to
be lynched by the crowd. The others were saying that that should
be restricted to cases where there were attacks by machine guns,
and the like, on the civilian population.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not think we need trouble with Paragraph (a) of the statement
of the Deputy Chief of WFSt. The importance of (a) goes
because Kaltenbrunner says that there were no such cases as were
mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you look at (b):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Deputy Chief of the WFSt pointed out that, besides the
lynch law, a procedure must be worked out for segregating
such enemy aviators who are suspected of criminal action of
this kind by sending them to the reception camp for aviators
at Oberursel and, if the suspicion was confirmed, handing
them over to the SD for special treatment.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As I understand that, it is that if they were not lynched under
the first scheme, by the crowd, then they were to be kept from
prisoners of war, where they would, of course, be subject to the
protecting power’s intervention. And if the suspicion was confirmed,
they would be handed over to the SD to be killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then in Paragraph 3 we have what was decided to justify the
lynch law. Paragraph 3 says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At a conference with Colonel Von Brauchitsch (Colonel of
the Air Force) on the 6th of June, it was settled that the
following actions are to be regarded as terror actions justifying
lynch law:</p>
<hr class='tbk110'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Low-level attacks with aircraft armament on the civilian
population, single persons as well as crowds.</p>
<hr class='tbk111'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Shooting in the air our own (German) men who had bailed out.</p>
<hr class='tbk112'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Attacks with aircraft armament on passenger trains in the
public service.
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk113'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Attacks with aircraft armament on military hospitals, hospitals,
and hospital trains, which are clearly marked with the
red cross.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These were to be the subject of lynching and not, as this defendant
had suggested, a case where there was the bombing of a city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then on the next page, the last page of this document, we have
a somewhat curious comment from the Defendant Keitel:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Remarks by the Chief of the OKW on the agenda dated 6
June 1944.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The number is that of the document at which the Tribunal has just
been looking.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Most secret; Staff officers only.</p>
<hr class='tbk114'/>
<p class='noindent'>“If one allows the people to carry out lynch law, it is difficult
to enforce rules.</p>
<hr class='tbk115'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Ministerial Director Berndt got out and shot the enemy
aviator on the road. I am against legal procedure. It doesn’t
work out.”—Signed—“Keitel.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then the Defendant Jodl’s comment appears:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This conference is insufficient. The following points must be
decided quite definitely in conjunction with the Foreign Office:</p>
<hr class='tbk116'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. What do we consider as murder? Is the Foreign Office in
agreement with point 3b?</p>
<hr class='tbk117'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. How should the procedure be carried out? a. By the
people? b. By the authorities?</p>
<hr class='tbk118'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. How can we guarantee that the procedure will not be also
carried out against other enemy aviators?</p>
<hr class='tbk119'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4. Should some legal procedure be arranged or not?”—Signed—“Jodl.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is important, I respectfully submit, to note that this defendant
and the Foreign Office were fully in on these breaches of the laws
and usages of war, and indeed the clarity with which the Foreign
Office perceives that there were breaches of the laws and usages of
war, is shown by the next document, which is 728-PS, which I now
put in as GB-152. That is a document from the Foreign Office,
approved of by the Defendant Ribbentrop and transmitted by one
of his officials called Ritter; and the fact that it is approved by this
defendant is specifically stated in the next Document 740-PS, which
I put in as GB-153. I do not think this Document 728-PS has been
read before, and therefore, again, I would like to read just one or
two passages in it. It begins:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In spite of the obvious objections, based on international law
and foreign policy, the Foreign Office is basically in agreement
with the proposed measures.
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk120'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In the examination of the individual cases a distinction must
be made between the cases of lynching and the cases of special
treatment by the SD.</p>
<hr class='tbk121'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I. In the cases of lynching, the precise establishment of the
facts involving punishment, according to points 1 through 4
of the communication of 15 June, is not very essential. First,
the German authorities are not directly responsible, since the
death will have occurred before a German official becomes
concerned with the case. Furthermore, the accompanying
circumstances will be such, that it will not be difficult to
represent the case in an appropriate manner upon publication.
Hence, in cases of lynching it will be of primary importance
correctly to handle the individual case upon publication.</p>
<hr class='tbk122'/>
<p class='noindent'>“II. The suggested procedure for special treatment by the SD,
including subsequent publication, would be feasible only if
Germany would at the same time openly repudiate the commitments
of international law, at present in force and still
recognized by Germany. When an enemy aviator is seized by
the Army or by the Police and is delivered to the reception
camp for aviators at Oberursel, he has acquired by this very
fact the legal status of a prisoner of war.</p>
<hr class='tbk123'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Prisoner-of-War Agreement of 27 July 1929 established
definite rules for the prosecution and sentencing of prisoners
of war and the execution of the death penalty, as for example
in Article 66: Death sentences may be carried out only 3
months after the Protecting Power has been notified of the
sentence. In Article 63: A prisoner of war will be tried only
by the same courts and under the same procedure as members
of the German Armed Forces. These rules are so specific that
it would be futile to try to cover up any violation of them by
clever wording of the publication of an individual incident.
On the other hand, the Foreign Office cannot recommend on
this occasion a formal repudiation of the Prisoner-of-War
Agreement.</p>
<hr class='tbk124'/>
<p class='noindent'>“An emergency solution would be to prevent suspected enemy
fliers from ever attaining a legal prisoner-of-war status, that
is, that immediately upon capture they be told that they are
not considered prisoners of war but criminals, that they
would not be turned over to the agencies having jurisdiction
over prisoners of war, hence not go to a prisoner-of-war camp,
but that they be delivered to the authorities in charge of the
prosecution of criminal acts, and that they be tried in summary
proceedings. If the evidence at the trial should reveal
that the special procedure is not applicable to a particular
case, the fliers concerned may subsequently be given the
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
status of prisoner of war by transfer to the reception camp
for aviators at Oberursel.</p>
<hr class='tbk125'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Naturally, not even this expedient will prevent the possibility
of Germany’s being accused of violation of existing treaties or
even the adoption of reprisals upon German prisoners of war.
At any rate this solution would enable us to follow a clearly
defined course, thus relieving us of the necessity of openly
having to renounce the present agreements or of the need of
having to use excuses which no one would believe, upon the
publication of each individual case.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I do not want to take this in detail, but I ask the Tribunal to
look at the first sentence of Section III:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It follows from the above that the main weight of the action
will have to be placed on lynchings. Should the campaign be
carried out to such an extent that the purpose, to wit: the
deterrence of enemy aviators, is actually achieved, which goal
is favored by the Foreign Office, then the strafing attacks by
enemy fliers directing the fire of their weapons upon the
civilian population must be stressed in a completely different
propagandist manner than heretofore.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I don’t think I need trouble the Tribunal, but that shows quite
clearly the defendant’s point of view. If the Tribunal would look at
the next document, it is stated at the beginning of the second
paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Ambassador Ritter has advised us by telephone on 29 June
that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has approved this
draft.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is the position as to the treatment of aviators, where there
is, in my suggestion, a completely cold-blooded and deliberate
adoption of a procedure evading international law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second section is the destruction of the peoples in Europe.
With regard to Poland, again I want scrupulously to avoid going
into details; but I remind the Tribunal of the evidence of the Witness
Lahousen, which appears in the transcript, Pages 618 and 619 (Volume
II, Pages 448-449) on the 30th of November of last year, and
on Pages 713 to 716 (Volume III, Pages 20-25), when he was cross-examined
on the 1st of December.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Secondly, Bohemia and Moravia: On the 16th of March 1939
there was promulgated the decree of the Führer and Reich Chancellor,
signed by Ribbentrop, concerning the Protectorate of Bohemia
and Moravia. That is already in as Exhibit GB-8, Document TC-51.
The effect of that was to place the Reich Protector in a remarkable
position of supremacy under the Führer. The only part which I
would like the Tribunal to have in mind is Article 5 and Subarticle 2:
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The Reich Protector, as representative of the Führer and
Chancellor of the Reich and as Commissioner of the Reich
Government, is charged with the duty of seeing to the observance
of the political principles laid down by the Führer
and Chancellor of the Reich.</p>
<hr class='tbk126'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. The members of the Government of the Protectorate shall
be confirmed by the Reich Protector. The confirmation may
be withdrawn.</p>
<hr class='tbk127'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4. The Reich Protector is entitled to inform himself of all
measures taken by the Government of the Protectorate and to
give advice. He can object to measures calculated to harm
the Reich and, in cases of danger, issue ordinances required
for the common interest.</p>
<hr class='tbk128'/>
<p class='noindent'>“5. The promulgation of laws, decrees, and other legal provisions
and the execution of administrative measures and
legal judgments shall be suspended if the Reich Protector
enters an objection.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As a result of this law, the two Reich Protectors of Bohemia and
Moravia and their various deputies were appointed; and then there
were committed the various crimes which will be detailed by my
Soviet colleague.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Similarly, with regard to the Netherlands on the 18th of May
1940, a decree of the Führer was signed by Ribbentrop concerning
the exercise of governmental authority in the Netherlands, and that—Document
639-PS, which I put in as Exhibit GB-154, Section 1—says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Occupied Netherlands Territories shall be administered
by the Reich Commissioner for the Occupied Netherlands
Territories .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Reich Commissioner is guardian of the
interests of the Reich and vested with supreme civil authority.</p>
<hr class='tbk129'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Dr. Arthur Seyss-Inquart is hereby appointed Reich Commissioner
for the Occupied Netherlands Territories.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the basis of this decree, the Reich Commissioner—the Defendant
Seyss-Inquart—promulgated such orders as that of the 4th of
July 1940, dealing with the confiscation of property of those who
had, or might have, furthered activities hostile to the German Reich;
and tentative arrangements were made for the resettlement of the
Dutch population. But all this will also be dealt with fully by my
French colleagues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I simply for the moment put in as a matter of reference the
general order of the Defendant Seyss-Inquart, which is GB-155, the
document being 2921-PS. I do not intend to read it. I have summarized
the effect of it and it will be dealt with more fully by my
French colleagues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I want the Tribunal to appreciate, with regard to these two
matters, Bohemia and the Netherlands, that the charge against this
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
defendant is laying the basis and procuring the governmental structure
under which the War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity
were directed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should also put in formally Exhibit GB-156, the discussion on
the question of the Dutch population, which is contained in Document
1520-PS. Again I have explained it generally and I do not
want to occupy time by reading it in full now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then coming to the Jews: In December 1938 the Defendant
Ribbentrop, in a conversation with M. Bonnet, who was then Foreign
Minister of France, expressed his opinion of the Jews. That was
reported by the United States Ambassador, Mr. Kennedy, to the
State Department. The report of Mr. Kennedy is Document L-205,
which I now put in as Exhibit GB-157. If I might read to the Tribunal
the second paragraph, which concerns this point:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the day we had a telephone call from Berenger’s office
in Paris. We were told that the matter of refugees had been
raised by Bonnet in his conversation with Von Ribbentrop.
The result was very bad. Ribbentrop, when pressed, had said
to Bonnet that the Jews in Germany, without exception, were
pickpockets, murderers, and thieves. The property they
possessed had been acquired illegally. The German Government
had therefore decided to assimilate them with the
criminal elements of the population. The property which they
had acquired illegally would be taken from them. They would
be forced to live in districts frequented by the criminal classes.
They would be under police observation like other criminals.
They would be forced to report to the police as other criminals
were obliged to do. The German Government could not help
it if some of these criminals escaped to other countries which
seemed so anxious to have them. It was not, however, willing
for them to take the property which had resulted from illegal
operations with them. There was in fact nothing that it could
or would do.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That succinct statement of this defendant’s views on Jews is
elaborated in a long document which he had sent out by the Foreign
Office, which is numbered 3358-PS, which I put in as Exhibit GB-158.
I do not want to read the whole of that document because it is
excessively dreary; it is also an excessively clear indication of the
defendant’s views on the treatment of Jews. But if the Tribunal
would look at, first of all, Page 3—it is headed, “The Jewish Question
as a Factor in German Foreign Policy in the Year 1938”; after the
four divisions the document goes on to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is certainly no coincidence that the fateful year 1938 has
brought nearer the solution of the Jewish question simultaneously
with the realization of the ‘idea of Greater Germany,’
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
since the Jewish policy was both the basis and consequence of
the events of the year 1938.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is elaborated. If the Tribunal will turn over to Page 4 at
the beginning of the second paragraph, they will see the first sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The final goal of German Jewish policy is the emigration of
all the Jews living in Reich territory.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then that is developed at great length through a large number
of pages. The conclusion which is—if the Tribunal would turn to
the foot of Page 7 and examine it—it goes on this way:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“These examples from reports from authorities abroad can, if
desired, be amplified. They confirm the correctness of the
expectation that criticism of the measures for excluding Jews
from German Lebensraum, which were misunderstood in
many countries for lack of evidence, would be only temporary
and would swing in the other direction the moment the
population saw with its own eyes and thus learned what the
Jewish danger was to them. The poorer and therefore the
more burdensome the immigrant Jew is to the country absorbing
him, the stronger this country will react and the more
desirable is this effect in the interest of German propaganda.
The object of this German action is to be a future international
solution of the Jewish question, dictated not by false compassion
for the ‘United Religious Jewish Minority’ but by the
full consciousness of all peoples of the danger which it represents
to the racial composition of the nations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will appreciate that this document was circulated
by the defendant’s ministry, widely circulated to all senior Reich
authorities and to numerous people before the war, on the 25th of
January 1939, just after the statement to M. Bonnet. Apparently
the anti-Semitism of the defendant went from—I was going to say
from strength to strength, if that is the correct term, or at any rate
from exaggeration to exaggeration, for in June 1944 the Defendant
Rosenberg made arrangements for an international anti-Jewish congress
to be held in Kraków on the 11th of July 1944. The honorary
members were to be Von Ribbentrop, Himmler, Goebbels, and
Frank—I think the Defendant Frank. The Foreign Office was to
take over the mission of inviting prominent foreigners from Italy,
France, Hungary, Holland, Arabia, Iraq, Norway, et cetera, in order
to give an international aspect to the congress. However, the military
events of June 1944 prompted Hitler to call off the congress which
had lost its significance by virtue of the landings in Normandy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is contained in Document 1752-PS, GB-159. At the foot of
Page 1 the Tribunal will see the following had been entered as
honorary members: Reich Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop.
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
So that there is no doubt that this defendant was behind the program
against the Jews which resulted in the placing of them in
concentration camps with anyone else who opposed the Nazi way
of life; and it is submitted that he must, as a minister in special
touch with the head of the government, have known what was going
on in the country and in the camps. One who preached this doctrine
and was in a position of authority cannot, I submit to anyone who
has had any ministerial experience, suggest that he was ignorant of
how the policy was carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is the evidence on the third allegation and it is submitted
that by the evidence which I have recapitulated to the Tribunal
the three allegations are proved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to the second, Hitler’s own words were:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the historic year of 1938 the Foreign Minister, Von Ribbentrop,
was of great help to me by virtue of his accurate and
audacious judgment and admirably clever treatment of all
problems of foreign policy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>During the course of the war this defendant was in close
liaison with the other Nazi conspirators. He advised them and made
available to them, in his embassies and legations abroad, information
which was required and at times participated, as I have
shown, in the planning of War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is submitted that all the allegations which I read from Appendix
A of the Indictment are completely proved against this defendant.
I want, if the Tribunal will allow me, to add only one fact
on behalf of the British Delegation. In the preparation of these
briefs we have received great assistance from certain of our
American colleagues; and I should like to thank once, but nonetheless
heartily, on behalf of us all, Dr. Kempner’s staff: Captains
Auchincloss, Claggett, and Stoll, Lieutenants Felton and Heller, and
Mr. Lachmann for the great help they have been to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>DR. ALFRED SEIDL (Counsel for the Defendant Frank): May it
please the Tribunal, I have a motion to make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: On behalf of whom?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I want to make a motion which concerns the indictment
of Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Charter of the Tribunal contains, in Part IV, regulations
for a fair trial, and Article 16 prescribes that for the purpose of
safeguarding the right of the defendants the following procedure
shall be followed. “The Indictment shall include full particulars
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
specifying in detail the charges against the defendant. A copy of
the Indictment, and of all the documents lodged with the Indictment,
translated into a language which he understands, shall be
furnished to the defendant at a reasonable time before the Trial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the beginning of the Trial the Defendant Frank was handed
a copy of the Indictment. This is the Indictment which was read
on the first day. This is, if I may say so, a general indictment. All
actions are listed therein which, according to the opinion of the
Signatories of the London Agreement, are regarded as Crimes
against Peace, War Crimes, and Crimes against Humanity. The
Indictment does not contain in detail the criminal actions of each
defendant. I am now thinking about positive actions or concrete
actions or omissions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This morning I received a document. It has the title, “The
Individual Responsibility of the Defendant Hans Frank for Crimes
against Peace, War Crimes, and Crimes against Humanity”—or in
German “Die persönliche Verantwortlichkeit des Angeklagten Frank
für Verbrechen gegen den Frieden, für Kriegsverbrechen und Verbrechen
gegen die Menschheit.” This document is without any table
of contents. It consists of 30 typewritten pages. In addition to this
document, or indictment, as I should like to call it, another document
book has been given to me, namely, “Document Book Hans
Frank.” The first document, as well as the second document is not
in German but in English. This first document is in reality what
I should call the indictment against Frank, because here in this
document of 30 pages for the first time those individual activities
of Frank are listed which are to be regarded as criminal actions.
At least one ought to say that this document is an essential part
of the Indictment.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Forgive me for interrupting you. The
Tribunal has already expressed its desire that a motion such as
this should be made in writing. The Tribunal considers that a
motion of the sort which you are now making orally is a waste of
the Tribunal’s time and it therefore desires you to put your motion
in writing. It will then be considered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I regret myself that I must make this motion now,
but I was not able to make this motion in writing before receiving
this document only two and a half hours ago. My motion is that
the Prosecution should submit these two documents to the Defendant
Frank in the German language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal has not got the documents to
which you are referring. It is quite impossible for us to understand
the motion you are making unless you make it in writing and
attach the documents or in some other way describe or explain to
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
us what the documents are. We have not got the documents that
you are referring to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Then I shall make my motion in writing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Roberts, can you explain to me what
the counsel who has just spoken is complaining about?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. G. D. ROBERTS (Leading Counsel for the United Kingdom):
I gather he was complaining that the trial brief and the document
book which had been served on his client, Frank, were in English
and not in German.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Who is dealing with the case against Frank?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. ROBERTS: It is being dealt with by the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps I had better ask Colonel Storey then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COLONEL ROBERT G. STOREY (Executive Trial Counsel for
the United States): If the Tribunal please, I think what counsel is
referring to is the practice we have made of delivering in advance
a copy of the document book and a copy of the trial brief. In this
particular instance I happen to know that what counsel refers to
is the trial address, which is to be read over the microphone, and
as a courtesy to counsel they have been delivered in advance of
the presentation, just like all the other document books and briefs
against the other individual defendants. That’s what it is, as I
understand it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The documents which will be presented
against the Defendant Frank will be all translated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. STOREY: I am sure they are; yes, Sir. I don’t know about
the individual case, but the instructions are that the documents will
have two photostats, each one in German, plus the English translation,
for counsel, and that is what has been delivered, plus the
trial address, if Your Honor pleases. We handed that to him in
advance—what the attorney will read over the microphone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Storey, I thought the Tribunal
ordered, after consulting the prosecutors as to the feasibility of
the scheme, that sufficient translators should be supplied to the
defendants’ counsel so that such documents as trial briefs, if in the
English language, might be translated to defendants’ counsel. You
will remember it was suggested that at least four translators, I
think, should be supplied to the defendants’ counsel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. STOREY: If the Tribunal will recall, I think this is what
was finally determined; that document books and briefs could be
submitted in English and the photostatic copies submitted to
defendants’ counsel and that if they wanted additional copies of
the German, then they should request them and they would be
furnished. I think that is what the final order was.
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: There was, at any rate, a suggestion that
translators should be ordered to translate such documents as trial
briefs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. STOREY: That is correct; yes, Sir, and whenever counsel
wanted more copies, then they would request them and they would
be available for them. The translators or translations or photostats
would be available if they requested them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Were there any other questions, Your Honor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you mean that translators have not been
supplied to defendants’ counsel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. STOREY: If Your Honor pleases, as I understand, the
defendants’ Information Center is now under the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal, and my information is—I would like to check it—that
when they want extra copies all they have to do is ask for them
and they may obtain them and sufficient translators are available
to provide the extra copies if they want them. That is my information.
I have not checked it in the last few days, but sufficient
copies in English are furnished for all the counsel; and these
briefs and document books are furnished to them in advance. In
this case I am told that the document book and the briefs were
furnished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ SAUTER (Counsel for Defendants Funk and Von
Schirach): Your Honor, you may be assured that we Defense
Counsel do not like to take up the time of the Tribunal for
such discussions which we ourselves would rather avoid. But the
question just raised by a colleague of mine is really very unpleasant
for us Defense Counsel and makes our work extremely difficult
for us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You see, it does not help us if agreements are made or regulations
are issued and in actual practice it is entirely different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Last night, for example, we received a big volume of documents
all of which were in English. Now, in the evening in the
prison we are supposed to spend hours discussing with our
clients the results of the proceedings, a task which has now been
rendered still more difficult by the installation of wire screens
in the consultation room. In addition we are also required to
talk over whole volumes of documents written in English, and that
is practically impossible. Time and again these documents are not
received until the evening before the day of the proceedings; and
it is not possible, even for one who knows English well, to make
the necessary preparation.
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The same thing is true of the individual trial briefs; and I do
not know whether the actual trial briefs, such as we receive for
each defendant, have also been submitted to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Nearly every document which has been
referred to in this branch of the case, which has been presented by
Mr. Albrecht and by Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, are documents which
have been referred to previously in the Trial and which must
have been before the defendants’ counsel for many days—for
weeks—and therefore there can be no lack of familiarity with those
documents. The documents which have been referred to, which
are fresh documents, are very few indeed and the passages in them
which are now being put in evidence are all read over the
microphone and, therefore, are heard by defendants’ counsel in
German and can be studied by German counsel tomorrow morning
in the transcript of the shorthand notes; and I do not see, therefore,
what hardship is being imposed upon German counsel by the
method which is being adopted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You see, the Counsel for the Prosecution, out of courtesy to
Counsel for the Defense, have been giving them their trial briefs
in English beforehand. But there is no strict obligation to do
that; and insofar as the actual evidence is concerned, all of which
is contained in documents, as I have already pointed out to you,
the vast majority of those documents have already been put in
many days ago and have been in the hands of German counsel ever
since, in the German language—and also the documents which are
now put in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: No, this is not true, Your Honor. This is the
complaint which we of the Defense Counsel, because we dislike to
approach the Tribunal with such complaints, have been discussing
among ourselves—the complaint that we do not receive German
documents. You may be assured, Mr. President, that if things were
as you believe, none of us would complain but we would all be
very grateful; but in reality it is different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But Dr. Sauter, surely when you have a
reference to a German document, that German document is available
to you in the Information Center; and as these documents
have been put in evidence, some of them as long ago as the 20th
of November or shortly thereafter, surely there must have been
adequate time for defendants’ counsel to study them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Suppose, for instance, I receive this morning a
volume on Funk. I know, for instance, when Funk’s case comes
on—perhaps tomorrow. It is quite impossible for me to study this
volume of English documents upon my return from the prison at
10 o’clock in the evening. That simply overtaxes the physical
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
strength of a Defense Counsel. I could go through it if it were
in German, but even so, it is impossible for me after finishing my
visit to the prison at 9 or 10 o’clock in the evening to go through
such a volume. We absolutely cannot do it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You see, Dr. Sauter, it is not as though you
had to cross-examine witnesses immediately after the evidence
is given. The documents are put in and it is not for you then to
get up and argue upon the interpretation of those documents. You
have, I regret to say, a considerable time before you will have
to get up and call your own evidence and ultimately to argue
upon the documents which are now being put in. Therefore, it is
not a question of hours, it is a question of days and weeks before
you will have to deal with these documents which are now being
put in. And I really do not see that there is any hardship upon
defendants’ counsel in the system which is being adopted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And you will not forget that the rule, which, in a sense, penalizes
the Prosecution, is that every document which is put in evidence
and every part of the document which is put in evidence, has
to be read in open court, in order that it should be translated over
the earphones and then shall get into the shorthand notes. I am
told that the shorthand notes are not available in German the next
morning but are available only some days afterwards. But they
are ultimately available in German. And therefore every defendant’s
counsel must have a complete copy of the shorthand notes,
at any rate up to the recess; and that contains all the evidence
given against the defendants, and it contains it in German.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Yes, Mr. President, what we are most anxious
to have done and what we have been asking for many weeks is
that the documents, or at least those parts of the document which
come into question, should be given to us in German translation.
It is very difficult for us, even if we know English, to translate
the documents in the time which is at our disposal. It is practically
impossible for any of us to do this. It is for this reason
that we regret that our wish to get the documents in German is
not being taken into consideration. We are conscious of the difficulties
and we are very grateful for any assistance given. We
assure you we are very sorry to have to make such requests, but
the conditions are really very difficult for us. The last word I
wish to say is that the conditions are really very difficult for us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Sauter, I am most anxious and the other
members of the Tribunal are most anxious that every reasonable
facility should be afforded to the defendants and their counsel.
But, as I have pointed out to you, it is not necessary for you, for
any of you, at the present moment, to get up and argue upon these
documents which are now being put in. By the time that you have
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
to get up and argue upon the documents which are now being put
in, you will have had ample time in which to consider them in
German.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Thank you, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR GEORG BOEHM (Counsel for the SA): I have repeatedly
asked to receive copies of everything presented in English. The
accusation against the SA was presented on the 19th or 18th of
December, and at the same time a document book was presented.
Today I received a few photostats, but I have not received the
greater part of the photostats or other pertinent translations. This
shows that we do not receive the German translations immediately
after the presentation. Nor are we ever able to read the transcript
of the proceedings on the next day or on the day after that. The
minutes of the session.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We are not dealing with the SA or the
organizations at the present moment. If you have any motion to
make, you will kindly make it in writing, and we will now proceed
with the part of the Trial with which we are dealing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BOEHM: Mr. President, will you permit me one more
remark? The minutes of December 17 and 18, 1945 I have received
today.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you mean the transcript of it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BOEHM: I received today the German transcript for the
18th and 19th of December 1945. You see, it is not a fact that we
receive the transcript the day after or a few days after the session.
I received it weeks later, after I asked for it repeatedly. I have
asked the appropriate offices repeatedly to give me a copy of the
document book in German, and I have still not received it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, we will inquire into that. One moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was a pause in the proceedings while the Judges conferred.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will the last counsel who was speaking
stand up?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am told that the reason for the delay in the case you have
mentioned was that there had been an error in the paging and
therefore the transcripts of those shorthand notes had to be recopied.
I understand that the delay ordinarily is not anything like so long
as that delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BOEHM: But I hardly believe that in the case of the
translation of the document book the delay is due to those reasons.
But even if the delay in this particular case should be justified,
it means that week after week I am hampered in my defense.
I do not know the day before what is going to be presented, and
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
I do not know until weeks afterwards what has been presented.
I am therefore not in a position to study the evidence from the
standpoint of a Defense Counsel. I do not even know what is contained
in the document book. I am thus obviously handicapped
in my defense in every way. The Prosecution keeps saying that
it will furnish the documents on time. This is apparently not
the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps you will kindly make your complaint
in writing and give the particulars of it. Do you understand
that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BOEHM: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. ROBERTS: May it please the Tribunal, it is my duty to
present the evidence against Keitel and also against the Defendant
Jodl and I would ask the Tribunal for permission, if it is thought
right, that those two cases should be presented together in the
interest of saving time, a matter which I know we all have at
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story with regard to Keitel and Jodl runs on parallel lines.
For the years in question they marched down the same road together.
Most of the documents affect them both, and in those circumstances,
I submit, it might result in a substantial saving of time
if I were permitted to present the cases against both of them
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. ROBERTS: Then I shall proceed, if I may, on that basis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lords, may I say that I fully recognize that the activities
of both these defendants have been referred to in detail many
times and quite recently by Colonel Telford Taylor, and my
earnest desire is to avoid repetition as far as I possibly can. And
may I say I welcome any suggestions, as I travel the road, which
the Tribunal have to make, to make my presentation still shorter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a substantial document book, Document Book Number 7,
which is a joint document book dealing with both the defendants.
Practically all the documents in that book have already been referred
to. They nearly all, of course, have a German origin. I propose
to read passages from only nine new documents and those nine
documents, I think, are shown in Your Lordship’s bundle and in
the bundles of your colleagues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I commence by referring, as shortly as may be, to the part
of the Indictment which deals with the two defendants. That will
be found on Page 33 (Volume I, Page 77) of the English translation.
It begins with “Keitel” in the middle of the page, and it
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
says, “The Defendant Keitel between 1938 and 1945” was the holder
of various offices. I only want to point out there that although
the commencing date is 1938 the Prosecution rely on certain activities
of the Defendant Keitel before 1938, and we submit that
we are entitled so to do because of the general words appearing
on Page 28 of the Indictment (Volume I, Page 68) at the head of
the appendix:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The statements hereinafter set forth following the name of
each individual defendant constitute matters upon which the
Prosecution will rely <span class='it'>inter alia</span> as establishing the individual
responsibility.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then the Tribunal will see:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Keitel used the foregoing positions, his personal influence,
and his intimate connection with the Führer in such a manner
that: He promoted the military preparations for war set
forth in Count One.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>If I may read it shortly—he participated in the planning and preparation
for wars of aggression and in violation of treaties, he
executed the plans for wars of aggression and wars in violation
of treaties, and he authorized and participated in War Crimes and
Crimes against Humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, “The Defendant Jodl between 1932 and 1945 was” the holder
of various positions. He “used the foregoing positions, his personal
influence, and his close connection with the Führer in such a
manner”—and this is not to be found in the text relating to
Keitel—“that: He promoted the accession to power of the Nazi
conspirators and the consolidation of their control over Germany.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I say, My Lords, here, that I know of no evidence at the
moment to support that allegation that he promoted the Nazi rise
to power before 1933. There is plenty of evidence that he was a
devoted, almost a fanatical admirer of the Führer, but that, I
apprehend, would not be enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then it is alleged against Jodl that he promoted the preparations
for war, that he participated in the planning and preparation
of the war, and that he authorized and participated in
War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lords, with regard to the position of the Defendant Keitel,
it is well-known that in February of 1938 he became Chief of the
OKW, Supreme Commander of all the Armed Forces, and that Jodl
became Chief of the Operations Staff; and that is copiously proved
in the shorthand notes and in the documents. Perhaps I ought to
refer to his position in 1935, at the time when the reoccupation of
the Rhineland was first envisaged. Keitel was head of the Wehrmachtsamt
in the Reich War Ministry, and that is proved by a
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
Document 3019-PS, which is to be found in <span class='it'>Das Archiv</span>; and I ask
the Court to take judicial notice of that. It is not in the bundle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jodl’s positions have been proved by his own statement, Document
2865-PS, which is also Exhibit USA-16; and in 1935 he held
the rank of lieutenant colonel, Chief of the Operations Department
of the Landesverteidigung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I just refer to the pre-1938 period—that is, the pre-OKW
period—to two documents, one of which is new. The first document
I desire to mention without reading is EC-177. I do not want
to read it. It is Exhibit USA-390. My Lords, those are the minutes,
shortly after the Nazi rise to power, of the working committee of
the Delegates for Reich Defense. The date is the 22d of May 1933.
Keitel presided at that meeting. The minutes have been read.
There is a long discussion as to the preliminary steps for putting
Germany on a war footing. Keitel regarded the task as most urgent,
as so little had been done in previous years; and perhaps the
Tribunal will remember the most striking passage where Keitel
impressed the need for secrecy: Documents must not be lost; oral
statements can be denied at Geneva.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I submit, if I may be allowed to make this short comment,
it is interesting to see in those very early days of 1933 that the
heads of the Armed Forces of Germany contemplated using lying
as a weapon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next document I desire to refer to is a new one,
and it is EC-405, Exhibit GB-160. I desire to refer to this shortly
because, in my submission, it fixes Jodl with knowledge of, and
complicity in, the plan to reoccupy the Rhineland country, contrary
to the Versailles Treaty. The Tribunal will see that these are the
minutes of the working committee of the Reich Defense Council,
dated the 26th of June 1935.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Court will see that, a quarter of the way down the page,
Subparagraph F, Lieutenant Colonel Jodl gives a dissertation on
mobilization preparation; and it is only the fourth and fifth paragraphs
on that same page, the last paragraph but one from the
bottom, that I desire to read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The demilitarized zone requires special treatment. In his
speech of the 21st of May and other utterances, the Führer
has stated that the stipulations of the Versailles Treaty and
the Locarno Pact regarding the demilitarized zone are being
observed. To the <span class='it'>aide-mémoire</span> of the French <span class='it'>chargé d’affaires</span>
on recruiting offices in the demilitarized zone, the Reich
Government has replied that neither civilian recruiting
authorities nor other offices in the demilitarized zone have
been entrusted with mobilization tasks, such as the raising,
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
equipping, and arming of any kind of formations for the
event of war or in preparation therefor.</p>
<hr class='tbk130'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Since political complications abroad must be avoided at
present”—I stress the “at present”—“under all circumstances,
only those preparatory measures that are urgently necessary
may be carried out. The existence of such preparations or
the intention of making such preparations must be kept in
strictest secrecy in the zone itself as well as in the rest of
the Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I need not read more. I submit that fixes Jodl clearly
with knowledge of the forthcoming breach of Versailles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the day before the Rhineland was reoccupied on the
7th of March 1936, the Defendant Keitel issued the directive which
has been read before, Document C-194, Exhibit USA-55, ordering
an air reconnaissance and certain U-boat movements in case any
other nation attempted to interfere with that reoccupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lords, I pass now to the 4th of February 1938, when the
OKW was formed. My Lords, shortly after its formation there was
issued a handbook, which is a new exhibit, from which I want to
read short passages. The number of the exhibit is L-211. It is
Document GB-161. Now, this is dated 19 April 1938; “top secret;
Direction of War as a Problem of Organization.” I read only from
the appendix which is entitled, “What is the War of the Future?”;
and if the Court will kindly turn over to the second page, I am
going to read, 12 lines from the bottom of the page, the line beginning
“Surprise”:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Surprise as the requisite for quick initial success will often
require hostilities to begin before mobilization has been completed
or the armies are fully in position.</p>
<hr class='tbk131'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A declaration of war is no longer necessarily the first step
at the start of a war.</p>
<hr class='tbk132'/>
<p class='noindent'>“According to whether the application of the rules of warfare
create greater advantages or disadvantages for the warring
nations, will the latter consider themselves at war or not at
war with the neutral states.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It may, of course, be said that those were only theoretical words
and they might apply to any other nation which might be minded
to make war on Germany. The Court can use its judicial notice
of the conditions of things in Europe in 1938 and ask itself whether
Germany had any potential aggressor against her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, My Lord, I emphasize that passage because I submit it so
clearly envisages exactly the way in which Germany did make
war in 1939 and in the subsequent years.
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I now start to tread the road which has been trodden
so many times and which will be trodden so many times again,
the road from 1938 to 1941: the final act of aggression. My Lord,
I believe that I can treat this, so far as Keitel and Jodl are concerned,
in a very few sentences, because I submit that the documents
which are already in, which have been read and reread into the
record, demonstrate quite clearly that Keitel, as would only be
expected, he being Chief of the Supreme Command of all the
Armed Forces, and Jodl, as only would be expected also, he being
Chief of the Operations Staff, were vitally and intimately concerned
with every single act of aggression which took place successively
against the various victims of Nazi aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, Your Lordship has in front of you the document book
and perhaps the trial brief in which those documents are set out
under the heading. If I might take first the aggression against
Austria, Your Lordship will remember, in Jodl’s diary on the 12th
of February 1938, how Keitel, who was something more than a
mere soldier, put heavy pressure upon Schuschnigg—that is Document
1780-PS, Jodl’s diary—how on the following day Keitel writes
to Hitler—Document 1775-PS, Exhibit USA-75—suggesting the
shamming of military action and the spreading of false but quite
credible news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the actual operation orders for “Operation Otto,” Exhibits
USA-74, 75, and 77, all of the 11th of March 1938, are OKW orders
for which Keitel is responsible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What are the numbers of them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. ROBERTS: My Lord, Documents C-102, C-103, and C-182.
One of them is actually signed or initialed by Keitel, and two are
initialed by Jodl. Those are the operation orders for the advance
into Austria, the injunction, if the Tribunal remembers, to treat
Czech soldiers as hostile and to treat the Italians as friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, that is the first milestone on the road, the occupation
of Austria. My Lord, the second is, is it not.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, perhaps if you are going to pass on
to another, we had better adjourn now until 2 o’clock.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MR. ROBERTS: May it please the Tribunal, I had got to the
commencement of the alleged aggression against Czechoslovakia;
and the Tribunal will remember that the leading exhibit on that
matter is the file 388-PS, Exhibit Number USA-26, the “Fall Grün”
file. My Lords, that file, in my submission, contains copious evidence
against both Keitel and Jodl, showing that they were taking the
natural part of the Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed
Forces and the head of the Operations Staff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I remind the Tribunal of Item 2. I do not want to read any
of these. I might just refer to the notes of a meeting on the 21st of
April 1938. The important thing to notice is that Keitel and the
Führer met alone, showing the intimate connection between Keitel
and the Führer. And it was at that meeting that preliminary plans
were discussed, including the possibility of an incident, namely, the
murder of the German Ambassador at Prague.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Item 5 in that file, dated the 20th of May 1938, shows the plans
for the political and the military campaign against Czechoslovakia,
issued by Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Item 11, dated the 30th of May 1938, is the directive signed by
Keitel for the invasion of Czechoslovakia, with the date given as the
1st of October 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are many items which are initialed by Jodl—Item 14 and
Item 17, to mention only two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps, for the purpose of the note, I should mention the others:
Items 24, 36, and 37.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is the directive, Items 31 and 32, dated the 27th of
September 1938, signed by Keitel, enclosing orders for secret mobilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jodl’s diary, Document 1780-PS, contains many references to the
forthcoming aggression, particularly the 13th of May and the 8th of
September; and there is a very revealing entry on the 11th of
September in Jodl’s diary, 1780-PS, in which he says.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you give us the date?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. ROBERTS: I beg Your Lordship’s pardon; 11th of September
1938.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the afternoon conference with Secretary of State Hahnke,
from the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda,
on the imminent common tasks. The joint preparations for
refutation of our own violations of international law and the
exploitation of its violations by the enemy were considered
particularly important.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I emphasize those words, “our own violations of international
law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lords, as a result of that conference the Document C-2,
which was referred to by my learned leader, Sir David, was prepared,
which the Tribunal will remember has in parallel columns the
possible breach of international law and the excuse which is then
going to be given for it. It was referred to so recently that I need
not refer to it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lords, I respectfully submit on that branch of the case that
there is an overwhelming case that Keitel and Jodl played an
important, indeed a vital part, in the aggression against Czechoslovakia
which led up to the Pact of Munich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lords, after the Pact of Munich was signed, as has been
pointed out many times, the Nazi conspirators at once set about
preparations for annexing the remainder of Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lords, at this point Jodl disappears from the scene for a time,
because he goes to do some regimental soldiering as artillery general
in Austria—artillery general of the 44th Division—and so it cannot
be said that there is any evidence against him from the Munich Pact
until the 23rd of August 1939, when he is recalled on the eve of the
Polish invasion to take up his duties once more as chief of the
operational staff of OKW.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far as Keitel is concerned, on the 21st of October 1938, less
than a month after the Munich Pact, he countersigned Hitler’s order
to liquidate the rest of Czechoslovakia and to occupy Memel—Document
C-136, Exhibit Number USA-104.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 24th of November 1938, Document C-137, Exhibit Number
GB-33, Keitel issues a memorandum about the surprise occupation
of Danzig.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 17th of December 1938, Document C-138, Exhibit Number
USA-105, he signs an order to the lower formations: “Prepare for
the liquidation of the rest of Czechoslovakia.” Those preparations
were made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 15th of March 1939 Keitel, who—I again repeat—was
more than a mere soldier, was present at the midnight conference
between the Führer and Hacha, President of Czechoslovakia, when,
under a threat of bombing Prague, Hacha surrendered the rest of
his country to the Germans. I refrain from referring to the contents
of the minutes, which have been read many times already.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lords, so that milestone is past. And again I submit, in all
that aggression it is clear that Keitel was playing a vital part as
Hitler’s right-hand man, commanding all the armed forces under him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now pass to the Polish aggression. Keitel was present at the
meeting at the chancellery on the 23rd of May 1939, Document L-79,
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
Exhibit Number USA-27, when it was said—just a few words so
familiar: Danzig was not the subject of the dispute; Poland was to
be attacked at the first suitable opportunity; Dutch and Belgian air
bases must be occupied; declarations of neutrality were to be ignored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The directive for “Fall Weiss”, the invasion of Poland, is Document
C-120(a), Exhibit GB-41. The date is the 3rd of April 1939.
The Tribunal will remember the plans were to be submitted to
OKW by the 1st of May, and the forces were to be ready for invasion
by the 1st of September. And that directive is signed by Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document C-126, Exhibit GB-45, is a follow-up of that previous
directive. It is dated the 22d of June 1939. The need for camouflage
is emphasized; and it is stated, “Do not disquiet the population.”
That is signed by Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 17th of August 1939, Document 795-PS, Exhibit GB-54,
Keitel has a conference with Admiral Canaris about the supplying
of Polish uniforms to Heydrich; and it will be noticed in the last
paragraph of the note that Admiral Canaris is against the war, and
Keitel argues in favor of it. And Keitel made the prophecy that
Great Britain would not enter the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit that Keitel’s vital part, again, in the preparation for
the aggression against Poland is clearly established beyond possibility
of dispute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jodl, as I have said to the Tribunal, was recalled on the 23rd
of August, as seen in his diary entry, Document 1780-PS, where he
says that he is recalled to take charge of the Operations Staff. He
says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Received order from armed forces high command to proceed
to Berlin and take over position of Chief of Armed Forces
Executive Office.”—And then—“1100 hours to 1330 hours—discussion
with Chief of Armed Forces High Command. X-Day
has been announced for the 26th of August. Y-Time has been
announced for 0430 hours.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And I submit that the Tribunal can infer the importance of Jodl
to this conspiracy from the fact that on the eve of the war he is
recalled to Berlin to take his place at the head of the operational
staff of the Supreme Command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Poland was invaded, and before I pass to the next aggression
may I just point out that, according to the evidence of General
Lahousen, if the Tribunal accepts it on this point, Keitel and Jodl
were in the field with Hitler on the 10th of September 1939. That
is in the shorthand notes, Pages 617 and 618 (Volume II, Pages 447
and 448). I don’t suppose there will be any dispute that the head
of the High Command and the Chief of his Operational Staff were
in the field.
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I pass now to Norway and Denmark. So far as both
are concerned we see from Document C-64, Exhibit GB-86, that on
the 12th of December 1939 Keitel and Jodl were both present at
Hitler’s conference with Raeder when the invasion of Norway was
discussed; and Keitel’s direct responsibility to those operations is
shown in my submission by Document C-63, Exhibit GB-87, in which
Keitel says that the operations against Norway will be “under my
direct and personal guidance.” And he sets up a planning staff of
OKW for the carrying out of those operations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jodl’s knowledge and complicity, in my submission, are clearly
shown also from the entries in his own diary—Document 1809-PS.
That is the second part of his diary. And the Tribunal will remember
the entry of the 13th of March 1940, in which he records that the
Führer was still looking for an excuse for the “Weser” operations.
That is the 13th of March, My Lord, 1809-PS:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Führer does not give the order yet for Weser. He is
still looking for an excuse.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then, on the 14th of March, “Führer has not yet decided
what reason to give for Weser Exercise,” which, in my submission,
if I may be allowed to make a short comment, shows up in a lurid
light the code of honor of the military leaders of Germany—still
looking for an excuse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, then, as we know, Norway was attacked unawares; and
then subsequently lying excuses were given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the invasion of the Low Countries and Luxembourg
equally, in my submission, is clearly shown by the documents to
have been controlled and directed by Keitel with Jodl’s assistance.
The Tribunal already have a note of the conference in May of the
lands to be occupied—Document L-79. Document C-62, Exhibit
GB-106, is a directive, signed “Hitler,” on the 9th of October 1939
and another directive, signed “Keitel,” on the 15th of October. C-62
comprises two documents, the 9th of October and 15th of October—two
directives, one signed “Hitler” and one signed “Keitel”—both
giving orders for the occupation of Holland and Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, Document C-10, Exhibit GB-108, dated the 8th of November,
is Keitel’s operation orders for the 7th Parachute Division
to make an airborne landing in the middle of Holland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document 440-PS, Exhibit GB-107, dated the 20th of November
1939, signed “Keitel,” is a further directive for the invasion of
Holland and Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document C-72, Exhibit GB-109, 7th of November 1939, the 10th
of May 1940, 18 letters—11 signed by Keitel, 7 signed by Jodl: “The
Führer is postponing A-Day because of the weather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, Jodl’s diary is also eloquent on that subject. That is
Document 1809-PS. Several entries—perhaps I need not refer to
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
them again—relating to these forthcoming operations, culminating
with the one on the 8th of May, which perhaps the Tribunal will
remember, when Jodl says, “Alarming information from Holland,”
and he expresses righteous indignation that the wicked Dutchmen
should erect roadblocks and make mobilization preparations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, and so those three neutral countries were invaded,
and I submit there is copious and overwhelming evidence that these
men were in charge of the military organizations which made those
invasions possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I pass now to the planning for the aggression against
Greece and Yugoslavia. Document PS-1541, Exhibit GB-117, dated
13th of December 1940, Hitler’s order for “Marita,” the operation
against Greece, signed by Hitler, and a copy to Keitel, namely, OKW.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document 448-PS, Exhibit GB-118, 11th of January 1941: Keitel
initialed a Hitler order for the Greek operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document C-134, Exhibit GB-119, 20th of January 1941: Both
Keitel and Jodl are present at the conference with Hitler, Mussolini,
and others when the operations against Greece and Yugoslavia are
discussed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document C-59, Exhibit GB-121, 19th of February 1941: The
dates of the operations against Marita are filled in by Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document 1746-PS, Exhibit GB-120, 27th of March 1941: A conference
with Hitler, Keitel, and Jodl present; the decision to attack
and destroy Yugoslavia is announced, and the Führer said: “I am
determined to destroy Yugoslavia. I shall use unmerciful harshness
to frighten other neutrals”—and these two soldiers were present
when that was said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I submit that on that the complicity of these two men
for that aggression is amply proved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I pass to Barbarossa—Document 446-PS, Exhibit USA-131,
dated 18th of December 1940—Hitler’s order for the Barbarossa
operation, initialed by Keitel and Jodl. Hitler says, the Tribunal
will remember, that he intends to overthrow Russia in a single rapid
campaign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document 872-PS, Exhibit USA-134, 3rd of February 1941: A
discussion with Hitler, Keitel, and Jodl re: Barbarossa and “Sonnenblume”—North
African suggestions. Hitler said, “When Barbarossa
commences, the world will hold its breath and make no comments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, Document 447-PS, Exhibit USA-135, dated 13th of March
1941: That is an operation order signed by Keitel re: the administration
of the areas which were to be occupied; showing again that
Keitel was more than a mere soldier; this is civil administration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document C-39, Exhibit USA-138, 6th of June 1941: Timetable
for Barbarossa, signed by Keitel, and Jodl gets a sixth copy.
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Document C-78, Exhibit USA-139, 9th of June 1941, is Hitler’s
order to Keitel and Jodl to attend the pre-Barbarossa conference on
the 14th of June 1941, 8 days before the operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, on those facts and documents on the position of these
two defendants, again I respectfully submit their participation in
this aggression is overwhelmingly proved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the last aggression is with regard to the provoked persuasion
of Japan to commit an aggression against the United States
of America. My Lord, there are two key documents; and both Keitel
and Jodl are implicated by both of them. My Lord, the first is
Document C-75, Exhibit USA-151, dated 5th of March 1941. It is an
OKW order signed by Keitel, copy to Jodl. “Japan must be induced
to take positive action as soon as possible” is a quotation from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document C-152, Exhibit GB-122, 18th of March 1941: The
meeting between Hitler, Raeder, Keitel, and Jodl—Japan to seize
Singapore. That is the relevant extract on that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, on those acts of aggression and those preparations for
aggression, I submit that the case against these two men is overwhelming.
It is clear, in my submission, that there could be no
defense open to them except that they were obeying the orders of
a superior. That defense is not open to them under this Charter.
No doubt all these wicked schemes germinated in the wicked brain
of Hitler, but he could not carry them out alone. He wanted men
nearly as wicked and nearly as unscrupulous as himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I now pass very rapidly to the question of War Crimes
and Crimes against Humanity. My Lord, it has already been proved
that Keitel signed the “Nacht und Nebel” decrees, committing persons
to incarceration in Germany where all trace of them was lost.
That is Document L-90, Exhibit USA-503.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is one fresh document that I desire to put in. Colonel
Telford Taylor put in Document C-50, Keitel’s order as to ruthless
action in the Barbarossa campaign. There is one complementary
document to that, Document C-51, which is Exhibit GB-162, Keitel’s
order dated the 27th of July 1941:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In accordance with the regulations concerning classified
material the following offices will destroy all copies of the
Führer’s decree of 13 May 1941”—that is C-50, the Barbarossa
decree—“in the communication mentioned above:</p>
<hr class='tbk133'/>
<p class='noindent'>“a) All offices up to the rank of ‘general commands’ inclusive;”—My
Lord, that means that corps commanders and downwards
should destroy copies—“b) group commands of the
armored troops”—that again means offices of the armed corps
below the rank of corps commanders should destroy the
copies—“c) army commands and offices of equal rank, if there
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
is an inevitable danger that they might fall into the hands of
unauthorized persons.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That is to say that even higher generals, if the war approaches
closely to them, should destroy these documents rather than risking
any chance of their being captured.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The validity of the decree is not affected by the destruction
of the copies. In accordance with Paragraph III, it remains
the personal responsibility of the commanding officers to see
to it that the offices and legal advisers are instructed in time
and that only these sentences are confirmed which correspond
to the political intentions of the Supreme Command.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That was with regard to German soldiers not being tried by court-martial
for offenses against Soviet troops: “This order will be
destroyed together with the copies of the Führer’s decree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I submit that the anxiety on the part of the OKW,
presided over by Keitel, to destroy that—I suggest an illegal order;
a barbarous order—is significant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I desire now to put in another document which is
almost the last document in the bundle, UK-20. Your Lordship will
find it flagged at the end of the bundle. It is from the Führer’s
headquarters, 26th of May 1943. It says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Re: Treatment of supporters of De Gaulle who fight for the
Russians.</p>
<hr class='tbk134'/>
<p class='noindent'>“French airmen serving in the Soviet forces have been shot
down on the Eastern Front for the first time. The Führer has
ordered that employment of French troops in the Soviet
forces is to be counteracted by the strongest means.</p>
<hr class='tbk135'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It is therefore ordered:</p>
<hr class='tbk136'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1) Supporters of De Gaulle who are taken prisoner on the
Eastern Front will be handed over to the French Government
for proceedings in accordance with OKW order.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then I read Paragraph 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Detailed investigations are to be made in appropriate cases
against relatives of Frenchmen who fight for the Russians, if
these relatives are resident in the occupied area of France. If
the investigation reveals that relatives have given assistance
to facilitate escape from France, then severe measures are to
be taken.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I offer that as Exhibit GB-163.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, there is a document which I feel I should put in, which
is the next document in the bundle. It is Document UK-57, Exhibit
GB-164. This is the last document, I think, in the bundle. My Lord,
it is from the Ausland Abwehr—I believe it is from the intelligence
foreign department. It is to the OKW and it is signed the 4th of
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
January 1944. My Lord, the heading is “Re: Counteraction to
Kharkov ‘trial.’ ” Paragraph 2 is all that I read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The documents concerning ‘commandos’ have been asked for
and thoroughly investigated by the Reich Security Main Office.
In five cases members of the British Armed Forces were
arrested as participants. Thereupon they were shot in compliance
with the order from the Führer. It would be possible
to attribute to them breaches of international law and to have
them posthumously sentenced to death by a Tribunal. Up to
the present no breaches of international law could be proved
against commando participants.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I read no more, and I submit that that is clearly an
admission of murder, not warfare at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, Keitel’s comments are to be found in the top left-hand
corner of that document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We want documents on the basis of which we can institute
similar proceedings. They are reprisals which have no connection
with battle actions. Legal justifications are superfluous.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is that not at the top signed by Keitel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. ROBERTS: It is typewritten in the office copy which is the
original.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: There is no actual signature?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. ROBERTS: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): How does it connect with Keitel
then?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. ROBERTS: “Vermerk Chef OKW”—that is “note of the
Chief of OKW.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, that is the first minute. My Lord, the second minute is on
the same subject, and it is dated the 6th of January 1944; and there
is a large red Keitel “K” initialed on the top of this letter, showing
that he got it. My Lord, the first paragraph deals with two officers
who were then at Eichstätt Camp in Bavaria. My Lord, there is no
importance in that paragraph, because those two officers are still
alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Attempted attacks on the battleship <span class='it'>Tirpitz</span>.</p>
<hr class='tbk137'/>
<p class='noindent'>“At the end of October ’42 a British commando that had come
to Norway in a cutter had orders to carry out an attack on
the battleship <span class='it'>Tirpitz</span> in Drontheim Fjord by means of a two-man
torpedo. The action failed since both torpedoes which
were attached to the cutter were lost in the stormy sea. From
the crew consisting of six Englishmen and four Norwegians,
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
a party of three Englishmen and two Norwegians were challenged
on the Swedish border. However, only the British
seaman Robert Paul Evans, born 14 January ’22 at London,
could be arrested .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the others escaped into Sweden.</p>
<hr class='tbk138'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Evans had a pistol pouch in his possession such as are used
to carry weapons under the armpit and also a knuckle-duster.
Violence, representing a breach of international law, could not
be proved. He has made extensive statements about the
operation. In accordance with the Führer’s order he was shot
on 19 January ’43.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Again I submit, that is murder. Violence representing a breach
of international law could not be proved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, then the third paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Blowing up of the Glomfjord power station.</p>
<hr class='tbk139'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On 16 September ’42, 10 Englishmen and two Norwegians
landed on the Norwegian coast dressed in the uniform of the
British Mountain Rifle Regiment, heavily armed and equipped
with explosives of every description. After negotiating difficult
mountain country they blew up important installations in the
power station Glomfjord on 21 September ’42. The German
sentry was shot dead on that occasion. Norwegian workmen
were threatened that they would be chloroformed should they
resist. For this purpose the Englishmen were equipped with
morphia syringes. Several of the participants have been
arrested while the others escaped into Sweden.</p>
<hr class='tbk140'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Those arrested are: Captain Graeme Black, born 9 May ’11
in Dresden; Captain Joseph Houghton, born 13 June ’11 at
Bromborough; Sergeant-major Miller Smith, born 2 November
’15 at Middlesborough; Corporal William Chudley, born 10
May ’22 at Exeter; Rifleman Reginald Makeham, born 28
January ’14 at Ipswich; Rifleman Cyril Abram, born 20 August
’22 in London; Rifleman Eric Curtis, born 24 October ’21 in
London. They were shot on 30 October ’42.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Again there is no suggestion that there was any breach of international
law. They were British seamen and they were in uniform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Paragraph 4:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The sabotage attack against German ships off Bordeaux.</p>
<hr class='tbk141'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On 12 December ’42, a number of German ships off Bordeaux
were seriously damaged by explosives below water-level. The
adhesive mines had been fixed by five English sabotage gangs
working from canoes. Of the 10 participants the following
were arrested after a few days.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then there followed six names, six British names—one an Irishman;
a lieutenant, a petty officer, a sergeant, and three marines.
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“A seventh soldier named Moffett was found drowned; the
remainder apparently escaped into Spain.</p>
<hr class='tbk142'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The participants proceeded in pairs from a submarine in
canoes upstream into the mouth of the River Gironde. They
were wearing olive grey special uniforms. After effecting the
explosions they sank the boats, and attempted to escape into
Spain in civilian clothes, with the assistance of the French
civilian population. No special criminal actions during the
flight have been discovered. All the arrested, in accordance
with orders, were shot on 23 March 1943.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel initialed that document. That document, read by my
learned leader Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe not so long ago, is Document
Number 735-PS, quoting Keitel as saying, “I am against legal procedure.
It does not work out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would you read the Page 5 which follows that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. ROBERTS: If it will please the Tribunal, that is what I
shall do. Page 5:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Führer’s headquarters, 9 January 1944. The Chief of
OKW has handed the Deputy Chief”—that ought to be WFSt,
that is Jodl—“the enclosed letter with the following account:</p>
<hr class='tbk143'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It is of no importance to establish documentary proof of
breaches of international law. What is important, however, is
the collection of material suitable for a propaganda presentation
of a display trial. A display trial as such is therefore not
meant actually to take place but merely to be a propaganda
presentation of cases of breaches of international law by
enemy soldiers, who will be mentioned by name and who
have already either been punished with death or are awaiting
the death penalty. The Chief of the OKW asks the Chief of
the Foreign Department to bring with him pertinent documents
for his next visit to the Führer’s headquarters.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As the Tribunal heard from my learned friend, Sir David
Maxwell-Fyfe, when he read Document 735-PS earlier today, Keitel
said, “I am against legal procedure. It does not work out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One can agree with Keitel after having read that record of what,
in my submission, is cold-blooded murder of brave men, brave soldiers
and sailors who were fighting for their country; and although
this Trial has a record of the death of brave men, of the murder of
brave men, there are few cases which are more poignant than those
shown in the documents to which I have just referred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have finished my presentation of the case against Keitel and
against Jodl. So far as Jodl’s part in the War Crimes and Crimes
against Humanity is concerned, he figures much less than Keitel.
Of course, he had no power of giving orders or directives, but we
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
see that he at any rate signed and circulated an infamous order of
the Führer saying that commandos ought to be shot and are not to
be treated as prisoners of war at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In my submission the evidence against these two men is overwhelming
and their conviction is demanded by the civilized world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your Lordships, Mr. Walter W. Brudno of the American Delegation
will present the case against Alfred Rosenberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. WALTER W. BRUDNO (Assistant Trial Counsel for the
United States): May it please the Tribunal, in connection with the
case against the Defendant Rosenberg, I wish to offer the document
book designated as United States Exhibit EE. This book contains
the English translation of all the documents which I will offer into
evidence, as well as the English translation of those documents
previously offered to which I will refer. The documents are arranged
by series in the order of C, L, R, PS, and EC, and they are arranged
numerically within each series.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your Honors will note that on the first four pages of the document
book there appears a descriptive list of documents. This list
is a tabulation of all the documents directly implicating Rosenberg,
including those previously offered, and those which I will offer into
evidence. Those previously offered are keyed to the transcript page
of the Record, and to their exhibit numbers. The list is included in
the document books. The list is included in the document books
made available to the Defense. This list will gather together in
one place all references to the Defendant Rosenberg which are in
the Record up to this point. In order to avoid repetition, I will not
refer to a great many of the documents previously introduced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indictment at Page 29 (Volume I, Page 70) charges the
Defendant Rosenberg under all four Counts of the Indictment. In
the presentation which follows, I will show that as charged in Count
One, Section IV, Subparagraph D, Rosenberg played a particularly
prominent role in developing and promoting the doctrinal techniques
of the conspiracy, in developing and promoting beliefs and practices
incompatible with Christian teaching, in subverting the influence of
the churches over the German people, in pursuing the program of
relentless persecution of the Jews, and in reshaping the educational
system in order to make the German people amenable to the will of
the conspirators and to prepare the people psychologically for
waging an aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will also show that Rosenberg played an important role in
preparing Germany for the waging of aggressive war through the
direction of foreign trade, as charged in Count One, Subparagraph E,
of the Indictment, and that his activities in the field of foreign
policy contributed materially toward the preparation for the
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
aggression charged in Subparagraph F in the Indictment and the
Crimes against Peace, as charged in Count Two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally I will show that Rosenberg participated in the planning
and direction of the War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, as
specified in Paragraph G of Count One of the Indictment. Particularly,
he participated in the planning and direction of the
spoliation of art treasures in the western countries and in the
numerous crimes committed in that part of the eastern countries
formerly occupied by the U.S.S.R.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The political career of the Defendant Rosenberg embraced the
entire history of National Socialism and permeated nearly every
phase of the conspiracy with which we are concerned. In order to
obtain a full conception of his influence upon and participation in
the conspiracy, it is necessary to review briefly his political history,
and to consider each of his political activities in their relation to
the thread of the conspiracy which stretches from the inception of
the Party in 1919 to the defeat of Germany in 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is both interesting and revealing to note that for Rosenberg
the 30th of November 1918 marked the “beginning of political
activities with a lecture about the ‘Jewish Problem.’ ” That statement
is found at Line 2 of the translation of Document 2886-PS,
which is an excerpt from a book entitled, <span class='it'>The Work of Alfred
Rosenberg</span>, a biography, and I offer this book as Exhibit Number
USA-591.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the Document 3557-PS, which has excerpts from an
official pamphlet entitled <span class='it'>Dates in the History of the NSDAP</span>, and
which I offer as Exhibit Number USA-592, we learn that Rosenberg
was a member of the German Labor Party, afterwards the National
Socialist German Workers Party, in January 1919 and that Hitler
joined forces with Rosenberg and his colleagues in October of the
same year. Thus, Rosenberg was a member of the National Socialist
movement even before Hitler himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I wish to offer Document 3530-PS, which is an extract
from <span class='it'>Das Deutsche Führer Lexikon</span>, the year of 1934-35, and I
offer it as Exhibit Number USA-593. In this document we obtain
additional biographical data on Rosenberg as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“From 1921 until the present he was editor of the <span class='it'>Völkische
Beobachter</span>; editor of the <span class='it'>N. S. Monatshefte</span>; in 1930, he
became member of the Reichstag and representative of the
foreign policies for the Party .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. since April 1933 he was
leader of the foreign political office of the NSDAP, then
designated Reichsleiter; in January 1934, deputized by the
Führer for the supervision of the ideological education of
the NSDAP, the German labor front, and all related organizations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Document 2886-PS, which I have just referred to, offered
as Exhibit Number USA-591, adds that in July 1941 Rosenberg was
appointed Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this general background information in mind the first
phase of proof will deal with Rosenberg as official National Socialist
ideologist. The proof which I will present will show the nature and
scope of the ideological tenets he expounded, and the influence he
exerted upon the unification of German thought, a unification
which was an essential part of the conspirators’ program for the
seizure of power and preparation for aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg wrote extensively on, and actively participated in,
virtually every aspect of the National Socialist program. His first
publication was the <span class='it'>Nature, Basic Principles, and Aims of the
NSDAP</span>. This publication appeared in 1922. Rosenberg spoke of this
book in a speech which we have seen and heard delivered in the
motion picture previously introduced as Exhibit Number USA-167.
On Page 2, Part 1, of the transcription of the speech, which is
our Document Number 3054-PS, Rosenberg stated as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“During this time”—that is, during the early phase of the
Party—“I wrote a short thesis which nevertheless is significant
in the history of the NSDAP.”—This is Rosenberg
speaking.—“It was always being asked what points of program
the NSDAP had and how they were to be interpreted. Therefore
I wrote the <span class='it'>Nature, Basic Principles, and Aims of the
NSDAP</span>, and this writing made the first permanent connection
for Munich and local organizations being created
and friends within the Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We thus see that the original draftsman of, and spokesman on,
the Party program was the Defendant Rosenberg. Without attempting
to survey the entire ideological program advanced by
the Defendant Rosenberg in his various writings and speeches,
which are very numerous, I wish to offer into evidence certain of
his statements as an indication of the nature and broad scope of
the ideological program which he championed. It will be seen that
there was not a single basic tenet of the Nazi philosophy which
was not given authoritative expression by Rosenberg. Rosenberg
wrote the book entitled <span class='it'>Myth of the Twentieth Century</span>, published
in 1930. This book has already been offered as Exhibit USA-352. At
Page 479, which Your Honor will find on the second page of Document
3553-PS, Rosenberg wrote on the race question as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The essence of the contemporary world revolution lies in
the awakening of the racial type; not in Europe alone but
on the whole planet. This awakening is the organic counter
movement against the last chaotic remnants of the liberal
economic imperialism, whose objects of exploitation out of
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
desperation have fallen into the snare of Bolshevik Marxism,
in order to complete what democracy had begun, the extirpation
of the racial and national consciousness.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg expounded the Lebensraum idea, which idea was
the chief motivation, the dynamic impulse behind Germany’s waging
of aggressive war. In his journal, the <span class='it'>National Socialist Monatshefte</span>,
for May 1932, which I wish to offer as Exhibit Number
USA-594, our Document Number 2777-PS, he wrote at Page 199:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The understanding that the German nation, if it is not
to perish in the truest sense of the word, needs ground and
soil for itself and its future generations; and the second sober
perception that this soil can no more be conquered in Africa,
but in Europe and first of all in the East—these organically
determine the German foreign policy for centuries.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg expressed his theory as to the place of religion in
the National Socialist State in his <span class='it'>Myth of the Twentieth Century</span>,
additional excerpts from which are cited in Document 2891-PS.
At Page 215 of the “Myth” he wrote as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We now realize that the central supreme values of the
Roman and the Protestant Churches being a negative
Christianity do not respond to our soul, that they hinder the
organic powers of the people designated as a Nordic race,
that they must give way to them, that they have to be
remodelled to conform to a Germanic Christianity. Therein
lies the meaning of the present religious search.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the place of traditional Christianity, Rosenberg sought to
implant the neo-pagan myth of the blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you want to break off here for a recess?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. BRUDNO: Yes, Your Honor.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I have an announcement to make to the
defendants’ counsel. In view of the applications which were made
to the Tribunal this morning, I immediately ordered on behalf of
the Tribunal that an investigation should be made of the complaints
made by defendants’ counsel about the delay in the delivery of
the transcript of the shorthand notes and such delay will be
remedied at once. The investigation shows that transcripts of the
sessions up to and including the 20th of December can be completed
by this afternoon. The transcripts for the sessions held since the
resumption of the Trial will be distributed, up to and including
the 8th of January, by tomorrow evening. Hereafter, the German
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
transcripts will be regularly distributed to the Defense Counsel
within a period of 48 hours after the session.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. BRUDNO: If Your Honors please, when the Court rose I had
just read a quotation of Rosenberg, in which he expressed his
views on Christianity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the place of traditional Christianity, Rosenberg sought to
implant the neo-pagan myth of the blood. At Page 114 in the <span class='it'>Myth
of the Twentieth Century</span> he stated as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Today, a new faith is awakening; the myth of the blood,
the belief that the divine being of mankind generally is to
be defended with the blood. The faith embodied by the fullest
realization that the Nordic blood constitutes that mystery
which has supplanted and overwhelmed the old sacraments.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg’s attitudes on religion were accepted as the only
philosophy compatible with National Socialism. In 1940 the Defendant
Bormann wrote to Rosenberg in Document 098-PS, which has
been previously introduced as Exhibit Number USA-350; and I
quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The churches cannot be conquered by a compromise between
National Socialism and Christian teachings but only through
a new ideology, whose coming you, yourself, have announced
in your writings.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg actively participated in the program for elimination
of church influence. The Defendant Bormann frequently wrote
Rosenberg in this regard, furnishing him information as to proposed
action to be instituted against the churches; and, when necessary,
requesting that action be taken by Rosenberg’s department.
I refer to documents introduced in connection with the case against
the Leadership Corps, such documents as 070-PS, Exhibit Number
USA-349, which deals with abolition of religious services in the
schools; Document 072-PS, Exhibit Number USA-357, dealing with
confiscation of religious property; Document 064-PS, Exhibit
Number USA-359, which deals with the inadequacy of anti-religious
material being circulated to the soldiers; Document 089-PS,
Exhibit Number USA-360, dealing with curtailment of the publication
of Protestant periodicals; and Document 122-PS, which is
Exhibit Number USA-362, dealing with the closing of theological
faculties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg was particularly avid in his pursuit of what he called
the “Jewish question.” On the 28th of March 1941, on the occasion
of the opening of the Institute for the Exploration of the Jewish
Question, he set the keynote for its activities and indicated the
direction which the exploration was to take. I would like to quote
from Document 2889-PS, which I offer as Exhibit Number USA-595.
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
This is an excerpt from the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>, 29th of March
1941. This is a statement made by Rosenberg on the occasion of
the opening of the institute.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“For Germany the Jewish question is only then solved when
the last Jew has left the Greater German space.</p>
<hr class='tbk144'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Since Germany with its blood and its folkdom has now
broken for always this Jewish dictatorship for all Europe
and has seen to it that Europe as a whole will become free
from the Jewish parasitism once more, we may, I believe, also
say for all Europeans: For Europe the Jewish question is
only then solved when the last Jew has left the European continent.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It has already been seen that Rosenberg did not overlook any
opportunity to put these anti-Semitic beliefs into practice. Your
Honors will recall that in Document 001-PS, which was introduced
as Exhibit Number USA-282 in connection with the case on persecution
of the Jews, Rosenberg recommended that instead of
executing 100 Frenchmen as retaliation for attempts on lives of
members of the Wehrmacht, there be executed 100 Jewish bankers,
lawyers, et cetera. The recommendation was made with the avowed
purpose of awakening the anti-Jewish sentiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document 752-PS, which was introduced this morning by Sir
David Maxwell-Fyfe as Exhibit GB-159, discloses that Rosenberg
had called an anti-Semitic congress in June 1944, although this
congress was cancelled due to military events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the realm of foreign policy, in addition to demanding Lebensraum,
Rosenberg called for elimination of the Versailles Treaty
and cast aside any thought of revision of that treaty. In his book
<span class='it'>The Nature, Basic Principles, and Aims of the NSDAP</span>, written by
Rosenberg in 1922, he expressed his opinions regarding the Treaty
of Versailles. Excerpts from this book are translated in Document
2433-PS, and I offer the book as Exhibit Number USA-596. He
stated as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The National Socialists reject the popular phrase of the ‘Revision
of the Peace of Versailles’ as such a revision might perhaps
bring a few numerical reductions in the so-called ‘obligations’;
but the entire German people would still be, just
as before, the slave of other nations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then he goes on to expound the second point of the Party:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We demand equality for the German people with other
nations, the cancellation of the peace treaties of Versailles
and St. Germain.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg conceived of the spread of National Socialism throughout
the world and, as will be subsequently shown, took an active
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
part in promoting the infection of other nations with his creed.
In the <span class='it'>Nature, Basic Principles, and Aims of the NSDAP</span> he states:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“But National Socialism still believes that its principles and
ideology—though in individual methods of fight according to
various racial conditions—will be directives far beyond the
borders of Germany for the inevitable fights for power in
other countries of Europe and America. There too a clear
line of thought must be drawn, and the racial-nationalistic
fight against the everywhere-similar loan-capitalistic and
Marxist-internationalism must be taken up. National Socialism
believes that once the great world battle is concluded, after
the defeat of the present epoch, there will be a time when
the swastika will be woven into the different banners of the
Germanic peoples as the Aryan symbol of rejuvenation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This statement was made in 1922. It is thus seen that the Defendant
Rosenberg gave authoritative expression to the basic tenets
upon which National Socialism was founded and through the
exploitation of which the conspiracy was crystallized in action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg’s value to the conspiratorial program found official
recognition with his appointment in 1934 as the Führer’s delegate
for the entire spiritual and philosophical education and supervision
of the NSDAP. His activities in this capacity were vast and varied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now offer in evidence the <span class='it'>National Socialist Year Book</span> for
the year 1938 as Exhibit Number USA-597. At Page 180 of this
book, which is our Document Number 3531-PS, the functions of
Rosenberg’s office as the Führer’s delegate are described as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The sphere of activity of the Führer’s delegate for the
entire spiritual and ideological instruction and education of
the movement, its organizations, including the ‘Strength
through Joy,’ extends to the uniform execution of all the
educational work of the Party and of the affiliated organizations.
The office set up by Reichsleiter Rosenberg has the
task of preparing the ideological education material, of
carrying out the teaching program, and is responsible for
the education of those teachers suited to this educational and
instructional work.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As the Führer’s delegate, Rosenberg thus supervised all ideological
education and training within the Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Rosenberg’s personal belief that upon the performance
of his new functions as ideological delegate depended the future
of National Socialism. I offer Document 3532-PS as Exhibit Number
USA-598. This is an excerpt from an article by Rosenberg appearing
in the March 1934 issue of <span class='it'>The Educational Letter</span>. At Page 9 of
this publication Rosenberg states:
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The focus of all our educational work from now on is the
service for this ideology; and it depends on the result of
these efforts, whether National Socialism will die with our
fighting generation or whether, as we believe, it really
represents the beginning of a new era.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In his capacity as the Führer’s delegate for the spiritual and
ideological training, Rosenberg assisted in the preparation of the
curriculum for the Adolf Hitler schools. These schools, it will be
recalled, selected the most suitable candidates from the Hitler
Jugend and trained them for leadership within the Party. They
were the elite schools of National Socialism. The next document,
entitled “Documents of German Politics” is already in evidence as
Exhibit Number USA-365. Translations of excerpts from this document
are found in 3529-PS, Page 389, and read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As stated by Dr. Ley, Reich Organization Leader, on 23
November 1937 at Ordensburg Sonthofen, these Adolf Hitler
Schools, as the first step of the principle of selecting a special
elite, form an important branch in the educational system of
the National Socialist training of future leaders.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk145'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘The curriculum has been laid down by Reichsleiter Rosenberg,
together with the Reich Organization Leader and the
Reich Youth Leader.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Rosenberg exercised further influence in the education of Party
members in the establishment of community schools for all organizations
of the Party. Document 3528-PS is a translation of Page 297
of the 1934 edition of <span class='it'>Das Dritte Reich</span>, which I offer as Exhibit
Number USA-599. It reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We support the request of the Führer’s delegate for the
supervision of the entire spiritual and ideological education
and instruction of the NSDAP, Party member Alfred Rosenberg,
to organize community schools of all organizations of
the NSDAP twice a year, in order to show by this common
effort the ideological and political unity of the NSDAP and
the steadfastness of the National Socialist will.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This program was endorsed by the Defendant Schirach as well
as by Himmler, Ley, and others.</p>

<p class='noindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Aren’t you dealing with this rather in a
cumulative way? Isn’t it possible to summarize this evidence against
Rosenberg more than you are doing?</p>

<p class='noindent'>MR. BRUDNO: I will try to, Your Honor. However, although the
Indictment charges, and there is already substantial proof to show
that the defendant conspirators used ideological training as an implement
in achieving their rise to power and in consolidating their
control, there seems to be little evidence as to Rosenberg’s position;
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
and I am introducing this evidence in order to show that he played
a dominant role in this connection. However, I will try to summarize
these documents if I can.</p>

<p class='noindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I’ve taken down about 20 documents
that you have alluded to, all of which deal with Rosenberg’s ideological
theories.</p>

<p class='noindent'>MR. BRUDNO: Yes, Your Honor. I was merely trying to show
the scope of his activities.</p>

<p class='noindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='noindent'>MR. BRUDNO: Your Honors will recall that it was in his
capacity as Führer’s delegate that Rosenberg established the
Institute for the Exploration of the Jewish Question in Frankfurt.
This institute, commonly known as the “Hohe Schule,” has been
referred to in connection with the exposition of art plunders. Into
its library there flowed books, documents, and manuscripts which
were looted from virtually every country of occupied Europe.
Further evidence on this score will be introduced by the prosecutor
of the Republic of France.</p>

<p class='noindent'>Your Honors will also recall, and the Record shows at Pages
1671 to 1687 (Volume IV, Pages 81 to 92), that it was as ideological
delegate that Rosenberg conducted the fabulous art looting activities
of the Einsatzstab Rosenberg, activities which extended to virtually
every country occupied by the Germans. I will not attempt
to summarize the extent of the plunder and merely refer the
Tribunal to Document 1015(b)-PS, which has already been introduced
as Exhibit Number USA-385, and Document L-188, which
has been introduced as Exhibit Number USA-386. Document
1015(b)-PS details the looting of 21,000 objects of art; Document
L-188, the looting of the contents of over 71,000 Jewish homes in
the West. This subject, too, will be further developed by the French
Prosecutor.</p>

<p class='noindent'>The importance of Rosenberg’s activities as official ideologist
of the Nazi Party was not overlooked. In Document 3559-PS, which
I wish to introduce as Exhibit Number USA-600—this document,
incidentally, is the Hart biography of Rosenberg, entitled <span class='it'>Alfred
Rosenberg, The Man and His Work</span>—it is stated that Rosenberg won
the German National Prize in 1937. The creation of this prize, Your
Honors will recall, was the Nazis’ petulant reply to the award of
the Nobel Prize to Karl von Ossietzki, an inmate of a German
concentration camp. The citation which accompanied the award to
Rosenberg reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Alfred Rosenberg has helped with his publications to lay
the scientific and intuitive foundation and to strengthen the
ideology of National Socialism in the most excellent way.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
The National Socialist movement, and beyond that, the entire
German people will be deeply gratified that the Führer has
distinguished Alfred Rosenberg as one of his oldest and most
faithful fighting comrades by awarding him the German
National Prize.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The contribution which Rosenberg’s book, the <span class='it'>Myth of the
Twentieth Century</span>, the foundation of all his ideological propaganda,
made in the development of National Socialism, was appraised in
a publication Bücher Kunde in 1942. This publication is our Document
Number 3554-PS, dated November 1942. I offer it as Exhibit
Number USA-601. The first page sets forth an appraisal of the
<span class='it'>Myth of the Twentieth Century</span>.</p>

<p class='noindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Brudno, you referred us to the <span class='it'>Myth of
the Twentieth Century</span> on several occasions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>MR. BRUDNO: Yes, Your Honor.</p>

<p class='noindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We really don’t want to hear any more
about it.</p>

<p class='noindent'>MR. BRUDNO: I wish to show that this book is regarded as being
one of the pillars of the movement and I wish to show also, Sir,
that it had a circulation of over a million copies.</p>

<p class='noindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think it is absolutely clear from the
evidence which has already been given that Rosenberg was
enunciating doctrines of the ideology of the Nazi Party; and I
don’t think that it is necessary to go any further into details about it.</p>

<p class='noindent'>MR. BRUDNO: Very well. If the Tribunal is satisfied that Rosenberg’s
ideas formed the foundation for the National Socialist ideological
movement, I will pass on.</p>

<p class='noindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you have already brought out the fact
that he was appointed the Führer’s deputy for that purpose; wasn’t he?</p>

<p class='noindent'>MR. BRUDNO: Yes, Your Honor. I shall pass on from that point.
I would merely like to make reference, however, to Document 789-PS,
which has already been introduced as Exhibit Number USA-23. This
document records a meeting between Hitler and his supreme commanders,
on which occasion Hitler said, “The building up of our
Armed Forces was possible only in connection with the ideological
education of the German people by the Party.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>We submit that the contribution which Rosenberg made through
formulation and dissemination of National Socialist ideology was
fundamental to the conspiracy. As the apostle of neo-paganism, the
exponent of the drive for Lebensraum, and the glorifier of the myth
of Nordic superiority and as one of the oldest and most energetic
Nazi proponents of anti-Semitism, he contributed materially to the
unification of the German people behind the swastika. He provided
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
the impetus and the inspiration for the National Socialist movement.
His doctrines were responsible for the sublimation of morality and
the crystallization of the Nordic dream in the minds of the German
people, thereby making them useful tools in the hands of the conspirators
and willing collaborators in the prosecution of their
criminal plan.</p>

<p class='noindent'>I now pass to the second phase of Rosenberg’s criminal activities—his
active contribution toward the preparation for aggressive
war through the international activities of the APA, the Foreign
Policy Office of the Party.</p>

<p class='noindent'>As previously indicated in my quotation from <span class='it'>Das Führer
Lexikon</span>, which is Exhibit Number USA-593, Rosenberg became a
Reichsleiter, the highest level of rank in the Leadership Corps, and
was made chief of the foreign policy office of the Party in April 1933.
The organization manual of the Party, Document 2319-PS, which I
offer as Exhibit Number USA-602, describes the functions of the
APA as including the influencing of public opinion abroad so as to
convince foreign nations that Germany desired peace. The far-flung
activities of the APA are indicated at Page 14 of the translation of
this document and are stated as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The APA is divided into three main offices:</p>
<hr class='tbk146'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A. Office for Foreign Areas with its main sections: a) England
and Far East; b) Near East; c) southeast; d) north; e) old Orient;
f) controls, personnel questions, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>
<hr class='tbk147'/>
<p class='noindent'>“B. Office of the German Academic Exchange Service.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk148'/>
<p class='noindent'>“C. Office of Foreign Commerce.</p>
<hr class='tbk149'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. Moreover, there is in the APA a main office for the press
service and an educational office.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The press activities of the APA were designed to influence world
opinion in such a manner as to conceal the conspirators’ true
purposes and thus facilitate the preparation for waging aggressive
war. The activities were carried on, on an ambitious scale. I offer
into evidence Document 003-PS, which is entitled <span class='it'>A Short Report
on the Activities of the APA of the NSDAP</span>. It is Exhibit Number
USA-603. The last paragraph on Page 5 of the translation describes
the press activities as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Press Division of the APA is staffed by persons conversant
with all languages to be considered. They examine
approximately 300 newspapers daily and deliver to the Führer,
the Führer’s deputy, and all other interested offices the condensations
of the important trends of the entire world press.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Press Division furthermore maintains an exact record
on the prestige of the most important papers and journalists
of the world. Many embarrassments during conferences in
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
Germany could have been avoided had one consulted these
archives.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Further, the Press Division was able to arrange
a host of interviews with me as well as conducting a great
number of unobjectionable foreign journalists to the various
official representatives of Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Hearst then personally asked me to write often about the
position of German foreign policy in his papers. This year
five detailed articles have appeared under my name in Hearst
papers all over the world. Since these articles, as Hearst
personally let me know, presented well-founded arguments,
he asked me to write further articles for his paper.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, Rosenberg used his foreign policy office to influence world
opinion on behalf of National Socialism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is interesting to note in passing that Rosenberg states, at
Page 4 of this document, that the Romanian anti-Semitic leader,
Cuza, followed his suggestions as—in Rosenberg’s words—“he had
recognized in me an unyielding anti-Semite.” We will hear more of
this affair shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nature and extent of the activities of the APA are amply
disclosed in a single document. This is the principal document to
which I will refer in this phase of the case against Rosenberg. This
document bears our Number 007-PS and is entitled, “Report on the
Activities of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Party from 1933 to
1943.” It is signed by Rosenberg. Portions of Annex 1, attached to
the report, have already been read into evidence as Exhibit GB-84.
The body of the report and Annex 2 have not been referred to
heretofore. As will be seen the document contains a recital of
widespread activities in foreign countries. These activities range
from the promotion of economic penetration to fomentation of anti-Semitism;
from cultural and political infiltration to the instigation
of treason. Activities were carried on throughout the world and
extended to such widely separated points as the Middle East and
Brazil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many of the APA’s achievements were brought about through
the subtle exploitation of personal relationships. Reading from the
middle of the first paragraph on Page 2 of the translation, which
refers to activities in Hungary, we learn that:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The first foreign state visit after the seizure of power took
place through the mediation of the foreign policy office. Julius
Gömbös, who in former years had himself pursued anti-Semitic
and racial tendencies and with whom the office maintained
a personal connection, had reached the Hungarian
Premier’s chair.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The APA endeavored to strengthen the war economy by shifting
the source of food imports to the Balkans, as stated in Paragraph 3
on Page 2 of the translation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Motivated by reasons of war economy, the office advocated
the transfer of raw material purchases from overseas to the
areas accessible by overland traffic routes.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then he goes on to point out that they had successfully shifted
the source of food imports, particularly fruit and vegetable imports,
to the Balkans as a result of the activities of the offices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Activities in Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg were confined,
according to the report, to “observation of existing conditions”—a
phrase which may have broad connotations—and “to the establishment
of relations, especially of a commercial nature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Iran the APA achieved a high degree of economic penetration,
in addition to promoting cultural relations. I quote from the middle
of the third paragraph on Page 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The office’s initiative in developing, with the help of commercial
circles, entirely new methods for the economic penetration
of Iran found expression, in an extraordinarily
favorable way, in reciprocal trade relations. Naturally, in
Germany, too, this initiative encountered a completely
negative attitude and resistance on the part of the competent
State authorities, an attitude that at first had to be overcome.
In the course of a few years, the volume of trade with Iran
was multiplied five-fold and in 1939 Iran’s trade turnover with
Germany had attained first place.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the last sentence on Page 3.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, now, Mr. Brudno, will you kindly
explain to the Tribunal how the paragraph that you just read bears
upon the guilt of Rosenberg in this Trial?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. BRUDNO: If Your Honor pleases, we submit that the
conspirators used, as one of the tools of conspiracy, the economic
penetration of those countries which they deemed strategically
necessary to have within the Axis orbit. The activities of Rosenberg
in the field of foreign trade contributed materially, we submit, to
the advancement of the conspiracy, as charged in the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you suggesting that it is a crime to try
and stimulate trade in foreign countries?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. BRUDNO: If Your Honor pleases, the expression of ideological
opinions or the advancement of foreign trade do not, in themselves,
constitute a crime, we agree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: There is nothing here about ideological
considerations. It is simply a question of trade.
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. BRUDNO: Further on, Your Honor, he mentions the cultural
activities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I was confining myself, in order to try to
get on, to the particular paragraph that you had just cited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. BRUDNO: I see, Your Honor; we are merely trying to show,
Sir, that the Germans used the foreign trade weapon as a material
part of the conspiratorial program.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: As I have said before, it is not possible for
me or for any member of this Tribunal to conduct the case of the
Prosecution for them. We can only tell them when we think they
are being irrelevant and cumulative and ask them to try to cut
down their presentation. It is for you to cut it down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. BRUDNO: Rosenberg goes on to state, if Your Honor please,
at Page 3 of the translation, that “Afghanistan’s neutral position
today is largely due to the office’s activity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with Arabia, he says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Arab question, too, became part of the work of the office.
In spite of England’s tutelage of Iraq, the office established a
series of connections to a number of leading personalities of
the Arab world, smoothing the way for strong bonds to Germany.
In this connection, the growing influence of the Reich
in Iran and Afghanistan did not fail to have repercussions in
Arabia.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg concluded his report with the statement that, with the
outbreak of war, he was entitled to consider his task as terminated,
and then he says, “The exploitation of the many personal connections
in many lands can be resumed under a different guise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now turn to Annex 2 of the report, which is found at Page 9
of the translation. This annex deals with activities in Romania.
Here the APA’s intrigue was more insidious, its interference in the
internal affairs of a foreign nation more pronounced. After describing
the failure of what Rosenberg terms a “basically sound anti-Semitic
tendency,” due to dynastic squabbles and Party fights, Rosenberg
describes the APA’s influence in the unification of conflicting
elements. I quote, beginning with the ninth line of the translation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“What was lacking was the guiding leadership of a political
personality. After manifold groping trials the office believed
such a personality to have been found in the former Minister
and poet, Octavian Goga. It was not difficult to convince this
poet, pervaded by instinctive inspiration, that a greater Romania,
though it had to be created in opposition to Vienna,
could be maintained only together with Berlin. Nor was it
difficult to create in him the desire to link the fate of Romania
with the future of the National Socialist German Reich in
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
good time. By bringing continuing influence to bear, the office
succeeded in inducing Octavian Goga as well as Professor
Cuza to amalgamate the parties under their leadership on an
anti-Semitic basis. Thus they could carry on with united
strength the struggle for Romania’s renascence internally and
her Anschluss with Germany externally. Through the office’s
initiative both parties, which had heretofore been known by
distinct names, were merged as the National Christian Party,
under Goga’s leadership and with Cuza as Honorary President.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg’s man, Goga, was supported by two splinter parties,
which had not joined the anti-Semitic trend, and Rosenberg states:
“Through intermediaries, the office maintained constant contact
with both tendencies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goga, the man supported by Rosenberg, was appointed Prime
Minister by the King in December 1937. The pernicious influence of
Rosenberg’s ideology had achieved a major triumph, for he states:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Thus a second government on racial and anti-Semitic
foundations had appeared in Europe, in a country in which
such an event had been considered completely impossible.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I will not deal at any length with the details of the political turmoil
that plagued Romania during the ensuing period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Brudno, I think the Tribunal are satisfied
that Rosenberg—I mean satisfied, subject to what Rosenberg himself
or his counsel may say—that Rosenberg tried to spread his ideology
abroad, and we don’t require any further detailed proof of that, and
we are also satisfied that we have heard enough of the activities of
the APA.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. BRUDNO: Certainly, Your Honor. We feel that if the Tribunal
is satisfied, we can pass on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Subject, as I said, to anything that Rosenberg
may prove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. BRUDNO: Surely. I would merely like to conclude with the
statement that the activities of the APA were, as indicated in this
Document 007-PS, primarily responsible for Romania’s joining the
Axis. It was a vital link in Germany’s chain of military strategy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would further like to call to Your Honor’s attention the evidence
which has already been submitted on the activities of the APA in
Norway, activities which led to the treason of Quisling and Hagelin,
for which they have been condemned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I come now to the final phase of the case against the Defendant
Rosenberg. We have seen how he aided the Nazi rise to power and
directed the psychological preparation of the German people for
waging of aggressive war. I will now offer proof of his responsibility
for the planning and execution of War Crimes and Crimes against
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
Humanity committed in the vast areas of the occupied East, which
he administered for over 3 years. These areas included the Baltic
States, White Ruthenia, the Ukraine, and the eastern portion of
Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will not endeavor here to chronicle again the tale of mass
murder, spoliation, and brutality. We feel that that has already
been sufficiently evidenced, and further evidence on this point will
be presented by the Prosecution for the U.S.S.R. and for the Republic
of France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We anticipate, however, that Rosenberg will contend that some
of these crimes were committed against his wishes, and, indeed,
there is some evidence that he protested on occasion—not out of
humanitarian reasons but on grounds of political expediency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We also anticipate that Rosenberg will attempt to place the blame
for these crimes on other agencies and on other defendants. The
evidence will prove, however, that he himself formulated the harsh
policies, in the execution of which the crimes were committed; that
the crimes were committed for the most part by persons and
agencies within his jurisdiction and control; that any other agencies
which participated in the commission of these crimes were invited
by Rosenberg to co-operate in the administration of the East,
although the brutal methods customarily employed by them were
common knowledge; and, finally, his Ministry lent full co-operation
to their activities, despite the criminal methods that were employed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg was actively participating in the affairs of the East as
early as 20 April 1941, 2 months prior to the German attack upon
the Soviet Union. On that date he was designated by Hitler as
commissioner for the central control of questions connected with the
East European region.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hitler order by virtue of which he received this appointment
has been read into the record in its entirety as Exhibit Number
USA-143, our Document Number 865-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The initial preparations undertaken by Rosenberg for fulfillment
of his task indicated the extent to which he co-operated in promoting
the military plans for aggression. They also show that he understood
his task at the inception as requiring the assistance of a multitude
of Reich agencies and that he invited their co-operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after his appointment by Hitler, Rosenberg conducted a
series of conferences with representatives of various Reich agencies,
conferences which are summarized in Document 1039-PS, previously
offered as Exhibit Number USA-146. This document indicated the
co-operation of the following agencies. It indicated that the co-operation
of these agencies was both contemplated and solicited by
Rosenberg. The agencies are as follows: OKW, OKH, OKM, Ministry
of Economics, Commissioner for the Four Year Plan, the Ministry of
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
the Interior, Reich Youth Leadership, the German Labor Front,
Ministry of Labor, the SS, the SA, and several others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These arrangements, it should be noted, were made by Rosenberg
in his capacity as commissioner on Eastern questions, before the
attack on the Soviet Union, before he was appointed as Reich Minister
for the occupied East, in fact, before there was any occupied East
for Germany to administer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like to refer briefly to some of Rosenberg’s basic attitudes
regarding his new task and the directives which he knew he
would be expected to follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your Honor will recall that on 29 April 1941, in Document
1024-PS, previously introduced as Exhibit Number USA-278, Rosenberg
stated that:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“A general treatment is required for the Jewish problem for
which a temporary solution will have to be determined (forced
labor for the Jews, creation of ghettos, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>).”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On May 8, 1941 he prepared instructions for all Reich commissioners
in the Occupied Eastern Territories. These instructions
are found in Document 1030-PS, previously introduced as Exhibit
Number USA-144. The last paragraph, which has not been called
to Your Honors’ attention, reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“From the point of view of cultural policy, the German Reich
is in a position to promote and direct national culture and
science in many fields. It will be necessary that in some
territories an uprooting and resettlement of various racial
stocks will have to be effected.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In Document 1029-PS, which has been introduced as Exhibit
Number USA-145, Rosenberg directs that the Ostland be transformed
into a part of the Greater German Reich by germanizing racially
possible elements, colonizing Germanic races, and banishing undesirable
elements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech which Rosenberg made on 20 June 1941, Your Honors
will recall, he stated the job of feeding Germans was the top of
Germany’s claim on the East; that there was no obligation to feed
the Russian peoples; that this was a harsh necessity bare of any
feelings; that a very extensive evacuation will be necessary; and
that the future will hold many hard years in store for the Russians.
This speech, Your Honors, is in the record as Document 1058-PS,
Exhibit Number USA-147.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On July 4, 1941, still prior to Rosenberg’s appointment as Reich
Minister for the occupied East, a representative of Rosenberg’s office
attended a conference on the subject of utilization of labor, and
especially of the labor of Soviet prisoners of war. Document 1199-PS
is a memorandum of this conference, and I offer it into evidence as
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
Exhibit Number USA-604. It states that the participants were,
among others, representatives of the Commissioner for the Four
Year Plan, of the Reich Labor Ministry, of the Reich Food Ministry,
and of the Rosenberg office. The first sentence states, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“After an introduction by Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Krull,
Lieutenant Colonel Breyer of the PW Department explained
that actually there was a prohibition in effect by the Führer
against bringing Russian PW’s into the Reich for employment,
but that one might count on this prohibition being relaxed a
little.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The last paragraph records that, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The chairman summarized the results of the discussion as
indicating that all the bureaus concerned unqualifiedly advocated
and supported the demand for utilization of PW’s
because of manpower needs in the Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 16 July 1941, the day before Rosenberg’s appointment as
Minister of the occupied East, he attended a conference at the
Führer’s headquarters, the minutes of which have been introduced
as Document L-221, Exhibit Number USA-317. At that time Hitler
stated, “The Crimea has to be evacuated by all foreigners and to be
settled by Germans alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He further stated that Germany’s objectives in the East were
three-fold: first, to dominate it; second, to administer it; third, to
exploit it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, the character of the administration which was contemplated
for the occupied East was well established before Rosenberg
took office as Minister. He knew of these plans and was in accord
with them. Persecution of the Jews, forced labor of prisoners of
war, Germanization and exploitation, were all basic points of policy
which Rosenberg knew of at the time he assumed office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On July 17, 1941, Rosenberg was appointed Reich Minister for
the Occupied Eastern Territories. The decree by which he was
appointed is in evidence as Document 1997-PS, Exhibit Number
USA-319.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like now to examine the organizational structure and
the chain of responsibility which existed within the Ministry for the
occupied East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The organizational structure of the East was such as we will
show that Rosenberg was not merely a straw man. He was the
supreme authority with full control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document 1056-PS is a mimeographed treatise entitled, “The
Organization of the Administration of the Occupied Eastern Territories.”
It is undated and unsigned, but we can obtain further
information regarding it by reference to EC-347, which is Göring’s
Green Folder, already in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-320.
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It is noted that Part II, Subsection A, of Document EC-347 is
entitled, and I quote: “Excerpts from the Directives of the Reich
Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories and for the Civil
Administration,” and then in parenthesis, “Brown Folder, Part I,
Pages 25 to 30.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two paragraphs which follow are identical to two paragraphs
found at the top of Page 9 of the translation of Document 1056-PS.
Thus Document 1056-PS is identified as being a mimeograph of Part I
of the Brown Folder which was mentioned in the Green Folder, and
was issued by the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now offer Document 1056-PS as Exhibit Number USA-605. I
offer this document for the purpose of proving, from the directives
issued by the Rosenberg Ministry itself, the extent of Rosenberg’s
authority; that he was the supreme civilian authority in the Eastern
territories. The document will show that there was a continuous
chain of command from Rosenberg down to the regional administrative
officials, a chain of command which extended even to the
local prison warden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The document also will show the relationship which existed
between the Rosenberg Ministry and other German agencies, a
relationship which varied from full control by Rosenberg to full
co-operation with them, made mandatory by his directives and
by Hitler’s orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, the document will show that the various subdivisions
of the Ministry were required to submit periodic reports of the
situation within their jurisdiction, so that the numerous reports of
unspeakable brutality which Rosenberg received, and which are
already in the record, were submitted to him pursuant to his orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first paragraph of this significant document states as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The newly occupied Eastern territories are subordinated to
the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories. By
direction of the Führer he establishes a civil administration
there, upon withdrawal of the military administration. He
heads and supervises the entire administration of this area
and represents the sovereignty of the Reich in the Occupied
Eastern Territories.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the top of Page 2 of the translation is stated, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“To the Reich Ministry is assigned a deputy of the Reich
Leader SS and Chief of the German Police in the Reich
Ministry of the Interior.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Roman numeral III on Page 2 of the translation defines the
responsibility of the Reich commissioners as, and I quote:
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the Reich commissariats, Reich commissioners are responsible
for the entire civil administration under the supreme
authority of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern
Territories. According to the instructions of the Reich
Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories, the Reich
Commissioner, as a functionary of the Reich, heads and
supervises, within his precincts, the entire civil administration.
Within the scope of these instructions he acts on his
own responsibility.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then the chain of command is outlined: Subordinate
offices, general commissariats, main commissariats, district commissariats,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the second last paragraph on Page 3 of the translation it is
stated again:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Higher SS and Police Leader is directly subordinated
to the Reich Commissioner. However, the Chief of Staff has
the general right to secure information from him also.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk150'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Great stress is to be placed on close co-operation between
him, the Chief of Staff, and the other main department heads
of the office of the Reich Commissioner, particularly with the
one for policies.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To digress from this document a moment, I ask that the Court
take judicial notice of the decree signed by Rosenberg, dated
July 17, 1941, and found in the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> of the Reich
Minister for the occupied East, 1942, Number 2, Pages 7 and 8.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This decree provides for the creation of summary courts for
decisions on crimes committed by non-Germans in the East. The
courts are to be presided over by a police officer or an SS leader,
who have authority to order the death sentence or confiscation
of property, and those decisions are not subject to appeal. The
general commissar is given the right to reject a decision. Thus,
the determination of the SS, of these summary courts, is made
subordinate to the authority of a representative of the Rosenberg
Ministry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Page 4 of the translation of Document 1056-PS, the position
of the Commissioner General is defined. It is stated here that:
“The Commissioner General forms the administrative office of
intermediate appeal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three paragraphs down it is stated, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The SS and Police Leader assigned to the Commissioner
General is directly subordinated to him. However, the Chief
of Staff has the general right of requiring information from
him.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The document goes on to describe the function of the various
subdivisions of the Ministry, concluding with regional commissioners
who preside over the local administrative districts. They, too, have
police units assigned to them and directly subordinated to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, Mr. Brudno, surely that could have
been stated in a sentence without referring us to all these passages
in this document. I mean, Rosenberg was the Minister for the
Eastern Territories. He had under him Reich commissioners and
SS units, who had the full administration—civil administration—of
the Eastern Territories. If you had stated that, surely that
would have been sufficient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. BRUDNO: Very well, Your Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will proceed from that point, then, merely to point out that
the economic exploitation of the territory was undertaken in the
fullest co-operation with the Commissioner of the Four Year Plan,
as shown by Paragraph 2 of Page 7 of the translation. It is stated
there that the economic inspectorates of the Commissioner of the
Four Year Plan will be substantially absorbed in the agencies of
the civil administration after the establishment of the civil administration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I also wish to call Your Honors’ attention to the first paragraph
on Page 6, which reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>The various commissioners, it says, “are, aside from the
military agencies, the only Reich authorities in the Occupied
Eastern Territories. Other Reich authorities may not be
established alongside them. They handle all questions of
administration of the area which is subordinate to their
sovereignty and all affairs which concern the organization
and activity of the administration, including those of the
police, in the supervision of the autonomous agencies and
organizations and of the population.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now turn briefly to the second section of the document which
is entitled, “Working Directives for the Civil Administration.”
The first two paragraphs on Page 9 have been read into the record
as part of Document EC-347, Exhibit Number USA-320. I call
particular attention to the statement that the “Hague Rules of
Land Warfare, which deal with the administration of a country
occupied by a foreign armed power, are not valid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I continue quoting at the last paragraph on Page 9:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The handling of cases of sabotage is a concern of the Higher
SS and Police Leader, of the SS and Police Leader, or of the
Police leaders of the lower echelon. Insofar as collective
measures against the population appear appropriate, the
decision about them rests with the competent commissar.
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk151'/>
<p class='noindent'>“To inflict penalties in cash or kind, as well as to order the
seizure of hostages and the shooting of inhabitants of the
territory in which the acts of sabotage have taken place,
rests only with the Commissioner General, unless the Reich
Commissioner himself intervenes.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I conclude with this document by quoting the first sentence
at the top of Page 13:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The district commissioners are responsible for the supervision
of all prisons, unless the Reich commissioners intervene.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I will not take the time of the Tribunal, nor burden the Record,
with a detailed account of the manner in which Rosenberg’s plenary
authority and power were wielded. There is evidence in the Record,
and there will be additional evidence presented by the Soviet
prosecutor, as to the magnitude of the War Crimes and the Crimes
against Humanity perpetrated against the peoples of the occupied
East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, merely to illustrate the manner in which Rosenberg
participated in the criminal activities conducted within his jurisdiction,
I would like to refer briefly to a few examples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I call your attention to the document numbered R-135, which
was previously introduced as Exhibit Number USA-289. In this
document the prison warden of Minsk reports that 516 German
and Russian Jews had been killed, and called attention to the fact
that valuable gold had been lost due to the failure to knock out
the fillings of the victims’ teeth before they were done away with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These activities took place in the prison at Minsk, a prison
which, Your Honors will recall from Document 1056-PS, was
directly under the supervision of the Ministry for the occupied East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For my next illustration I wish to offer Document 018-PS. This
document has already been introduced as Exhibit Number USA-186.
I would like to read to the Tribunal the first paragraph of Document
018-PS, which has not yet been read into the Record. The
document reveals that Rosenberg wrote Sauckel on 21 November
1942, in the following terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I thank you very much for your report on the execution of
the great task given to you; and I am glad to hear that in
carrying out your mission you have always found the
necessary support, even on the part of the civilian authorities
in the Occupied Eastern Territories. For myself and the
officials under my command, this collaboration was and is
self-evident, especially since both you and I have, with regard
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
to the solution of the labor problem in the East, represented
the same points of view from the beginning.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As late as 11 July 1944 the Rosenberg Ministry was actively
concerned with the continuation of the forced labor program, in
spite of the retreat from the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): After making this generality,
Rosenberg goes on to object, at the last here, to the methods used.
You haven’t mentioned that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. BRUDNO: Quite right, Your Honor. Those objections are
already in the record, Sir, and I was merely referring to this
document to show that Rosenberg favored recruitment from the
East, that his civilian administrators co-operated with the recruitment
in spite of the methods used, the methods which were known
to Rosenberg as he reports in the letter himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. ALFRED THOMA (Counsel for Defendant Rosenberg):
High Tribunal, in this connection I must protest that the Prosecutor
did not finish reading this Paragraph 1 he has just quoted. For
then comes the sentence in which he states that an agreement
existed between Sauckel and Rosenberg regarding.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I don’t think you can have heard that the
United States Member of the Tribunal has just made this very
point, which you are now making to Counsel for the United States,
and has pointed out to him that he ought to have read there, or
drawn attention at any rate, to the other paragraphs in this
document which showed that Rosenberg was objecting to the
methods used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: High Tribunal, I would like to point out that
the prosecutor quoted just the first two sentences of a specific
paragraph. The same paragraph ends, however, where it is stated
that “there was an agreement between Sauckel and me according
to which workers were to be treated well in Germany, and for this
purpose welfare organizations were to be created”. The presentation
of the prosecutor creates the impression that the Defendants
Sauckel and Rosenberg had agreed only on the use of forced labor
without restraint and on the deportation of the workers from
the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: As Counsel for the United States pointed
out, the other passages in the document have already been read.
And, naturally, the whole document will be treated as being in
evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal fully realizes the point you are making, that it
is not fair to read one passage of a document when there are other
passages in the document which show that the passage read is
not a full or proper statement of the document.
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. BRUDNO: If Your Honor pleases, I was not attempting to
delude the Tribunal; it was merely in the interest of time that I
did not read the balance. The rest is in the Record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I realize that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 10 January 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span><h1>THIRTY-FIRST DAY<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>Thursday, 10 January 1946</span></h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MR. BRUDNO: May it please the Tribunal, when the Tribunal
rose yesterday I had finished the submission of proof as to Rosenberg’s
responsibility and authority in the Occupied Eastern Territories
and was about to conclude my presentation with four brief
examples as to the manner in which his authority was exercised.
I was in the middle of the third example, which, Your Honors will
recall, dealt with Rosenberg’s participation in the forced labor
program. I wish to conclude that illustration with reference to
Document 199-PS, which we offer as Exhibit Number USA-606.
This document is a letter from Alfred Meyer, Rosenberg’s deputy,
and is addressed to Sauckel, dated July 11, 1944. This time, Your
Honors will note, it is Rosenberg’s Ministry that is urging action.
I wish to quote Item Number 1 of this letter, which reads as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The War Effort Task Force Command formerly stationed
in Minsk must continue, under all circumstances, the calling
up of young White Ruthenian and Russian men for military
employment in the Reich. In addition the Command has the
mission of bringing young boys of 10-14 years of age into the
Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My third illustration deals with Rosenberg’s exercise of his
legislative powers, and I ask the Court to take judicial notice of
the decree signed by Lohse, who was Reich Commissar for Ostland.
This decree is published in the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> of the Reich Commissar
for Ostland, 1942, Number 38, Pages 158 and 159. It provides
for the seizure of the entire property of the Jewish population in
the Ostland, including the claims of Jews against third parties.
The seizure is made retroactive to the day of occupation of the
territory by German troops. This sweeping decree was issued and
published by Rosenberg’s immediate subordinate, and it must be
assumed that Rosenberg knew of it and acquiesced in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come to my final illustration. This illustration is derived
from Document 327-PS, which is already in evidence as Exhibit
Number USA-338.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a copy of a secret letter from Rosenberg to Bormann dated
17 October 1944. It furnishes a graphic account of Rosenberg’s
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
activities in the economic exploitation of the occupied East. I wish
to quote from the first paragraph on Page 1, which has not been
read into the Record. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In order not to delay the liquidation of companies under my
supervision, I beg to point out that the companies concerned
are not private firms but business enterprises of the Reich,
so that directives with regard to them, just as with regard
to Government offices, are reserved to the highest authorities
of the Reich. I supervise the following companies.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There follows a list of nine companies: A trading company, an
agricultural development company, a supply company, a pharmaceutical
company, and five banking concerns. On Page 3 of the
translation at Item 1 (a) the mission of the trading company is
stated to be, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Seizure of all agricultural products as well as commercial
marketing and transportation thereof. (Delivery to Armed
Forces and the Reich).”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now call your attention to Item 5 of the same page. It describes
the activities of the companies as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“During this period, the Z.O.”—that is, the Central Trading
Corporation East—“together with its subsidiaries has seized:</p>
<hr class='tbk152'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Grain 9,200,000 tons, meat and meat products 622,000 tons,
linseed 950,000 tons, butter 208,000 tons, sugar 400,000 tons,
fodder 2,500,000 tons, potatoes 3,200,000 tons, seeds 141,000
tons, other agricultural products 1,200,000 tons, and
1,075,000,000 eggs.</p>
<hr class='tbk153'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The following was required for transportation: 1,418,000
freight cars and 472,000 tons shipping space.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In conclusion we submit that the evidence has shown that the
Defendant Rosenberg played a leading role in the Nazi Party’s
rise to power by moulding German thought so as to promote the
conspirators’ ambitions; that he played a leading role in spreading
propaganda and intrigue, and in instigating treason in foreign
countries, so as to pave the way for the waging of wars of aggression;
and that he bears full responsibility for the War Crimes and
Crimes against Humanity which were perpetrated in the Occupied
Eastern Territories and which will be further developed by the
prosecutor for the U.S.S.R.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This completes the presentation of the case against the Defendant
Rosenberg. The next presentation will be that of the case
against the Defendant Frank, which will be presented by Lieutenant
Colonel Baldwin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LIEUTENANT COLONEL WILLIAM H. BALDWIN (Assistant
Trial Counsel for the United States): May it please the Tribunal,
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
we wish now to deal with the individual responsibility of the
Defendant Frank. In accordance with the expressed desire of the
Tribunal, this presentation has been strictly limited; and, of
course, I should welcome any direction from the Tribunal as to
length or method as I proceed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, I must acknowledge my indebtedness to Miss Harriet
Zetterberg, of our legal staff, and to Dr. Pietrowski, of the Polish
Delegation, for their invaluable work—Dr. Pietrowski and the
Polish Delegation, naturally, having a special interest in the Defendant
Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aspects of the criminal complicity of the Defendant Hans Frank
under Count One of the Indictment have been placed before this
Tribunal on several occasions. There remain, however, certain
matters for discussion—either novel in presentation or in development—concerning
this defendant as an individual, before the
United States’ portion of the Prosecution’s case against him is
completed. Our Soviet colleagues will carry further the heavy
complaint against the Defendant Frank in their treatment of War
Crimes and Crimes against Humanity in the East. We wish here
merely to touch upon that evidence which, we believe, irrefutably
discloses Frank to have been a tremendously important cog in the
machine which conceived, promoted, and executed the Nazi Common
Plan or Conspiracy. Documents relating to this point have
been assembled in a document book bearing the letters “FF.”
I am informed that these books, as well as explanatory briefs,
have been distributed for the use of the members of the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reference will be made in the course of this argument to the
so-called Frank diary, portions of which have already been brought
to the attention of the Tribunal. It seems appropriate that brief
mention should here be made of the content and source of this
diary. It is a set of some 38 volumes, most of which are on the
table at the front of the courtroom, detailing the activities of the
Defendant Frank from 1939 to the end of the war in his capacity
as Governor General of Occupied Poland. It is a record, in short,
of each day’s business, hour by hour, appointment by appointment,
conference by conference, speech by speech, and—in truth we
believe—crime by crime. Each volume, excepting the last few, is
now handsomely bound; and in those volumes, which deal with the
conferences of Frank and his underlings in the Government General,
the name of each person attending the meeting is inscribed in his
own handwriting on a page preceding the minutes of the
conference itself. It is incredibly shocking to the normal conscience
that such a neat history of murder, starvation, and extermination
should have been maintained by the individual responsible for such
deeds, but by now the Tribunal is well aware that the Nazi leaders
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
were sentimentally fond of elaborately documenting their exploits,
as witness the Rosenberg volumes displaying the looted art
treasures and the album reporting on the extermination of Jews
in the Warsaw ghetto. The complete set of the Frank diary was
found in Bavaria, at Neuhaus, near Schliersee, on 18 May 1945, by
the 7th American Army. It was taken to the 7th Army document
center at Heidelberg and on or about 20 September 1945 the
collection was sent to the Office of U.S. Chief of Counsel here at
Nuremberg. It is here in court in its entirety; and now its tones,
we submit, are those of accusation rather than boastful narration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the Defendant Frank held a position of leadership in the
Nazi Party and in the German Government is undeniable. Even,
presumably, it would be unfair to the Defendant Frank to underestimate
his importance in the Nazi hierarchy and the Third Reich.
Like the other defendants in this case, he was a man of far-reaching
influence and position; and his office-holding record is
already before this Court. It is an affidavit signed by the Defendant
Frank and identified as Exhibit Number USA-7. This document
contains a listing of 11 important positions held by Frank in the
Party and in the Government and supports the assertion of
influence and position which I have just made, especially since this
Tribunal has been fully apprised of the criminal activities of the
Nazi organizations and formations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The machinations of Frank divide themselves logically into
two periods. In the one, from 1920 to 1939, he was by his own
admission the leading Nazi jurist, although parenthetically the
word “jurist” loses its reputable content when modified by the
word “Nazi”. In the other period, extending from 10 October 1939
until the end of the war, he was Governor General of occupied
Poland. While he is most notorious for his persecutions and carrying
out of the conspiracy in the latter capacity, it is the opinion
of the United States Prosecution that the Defendant Frank’s contributions
to the Nazi rise to power as the leading Nazi jurist
should not pass without mention. It is with this aspect that I shall
first deal—the Defendant Frank’s furtherance of the realization of
the conspirators’ program in the field of law, his knowledge of the
criminal purpose of the program, and his active participation
therein.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Frank, himself, described his role in the Nazi
struggle for power in the following words, which were remarks
he ordered his secretary to place in the Frank diary on 28 August
1942. The remarks appear in the diary and are translated in our
Document 2233(x)-PS, which, if the Court please, is at Page 54
in the document book before it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The numbers of the pages of the document book will be found
in the upper right-hand corner in colored pencil, either red or
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
blue. The original of this document I now offer in evidence as
Exhibit Number USA-607. In the German text these extracts
appear in Part 3 of the 1942 diary volume on Pages 968, 969, and
983. Frank says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have since 1920 continually dedicated my work to the
NSDAP. As a National Socialist I was a participant in the
events of November 1923, for which I received the Order of
the Blood. After the resurrection of the movement in the
year 1925, my really greater activity in the movement began,
which made me, first gradually, later almost exclusively, the
legal adviser of the Führer and of the Reich Party Directorate
of the NSDAP. I was thus the representative of the
legal interests of the growing Third Reich in a legal-ideological
as well as in a practical way.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>He goes on to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The culmination of this work I see in the Leipzig army
trial, in which I succeeded in having the Führer admitted
to the famous oath of legality, a circumstance which gave
the Movement legal grounds to expand on a large scale.
The Führer, indeed, recognized this achievement and in 1926
made me leader of the National Socialist Lawyers’ League;
in 1929, Reichsleiter of the Reich Legal Office of the NSDAP;
in March 1933, Bavarian Minister of Justice; in the same
year, Reich Commissioner for Justice; in 1934, President of
the Academy of German Law, founded by me; and in
December 1934, Reich Minister without Portfolio. And in
1939, I was finally appointed Governor General for the
occupied Polish territories.</p>
<hr class='tbk154'/>
<p class='noindent'>“So I was, am, and will remain the representative jurist
of the struggle period of National Socialism.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk155'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I profess myself now and always, as a National Socialist
and a faithful follower of the Führer, Adolf Hitler, whom
I have now served since 1919.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is indeed significant and worth mentioning to the Court.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is this an extract from his diary?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: Yes, Sir; it is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And are the words “Present: Dr. Hans Frank
and others” written by him in his diary?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: Yes, Sir; they are. Before each of these
excerpts, if Your Honor pleases, if it was in conference it was
indicated which members of the Government General were present
or who made the address.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: It is indeed significant and worth mentioning
to the Court that the Defendant Frank assumes responsibility
for the so-called oath of legality at the Leipzig army trial.
At that trial, in 1930, three army officers were accused of—curiously
enough—conspiracy to high treason. The charge was that
the defendants in that trial, in their capacity as members of the
German Army, tried to form National Socialist cells in the German
Army and to influence the German Army to such an extent that,
in the case of a Putsch by the National Socialists, the army would
not fire at the National Socialists, but would stand at ease
instead. All three of the officers were found guilty and sentenced
to 18 months’ confinement. At that trial, however, Hitler was a
witness; and during the course of the trial, testified under oath that
the term “revolution,” used by him, meant only spiritual revolution
in Germany and that the expression “heads would roll in the sand”
meant only that they would do so as a result of legal procedure
through state tribunals, if the National Socialists came to power.
This, if the Court please, was the so-called oath of legality, the lie
that the Defendant Frank provided his Führer as a facade for the
conspiracy and which he, at least in 1942, considered the culmination
of his efforts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the “representative jurist of the struggle period of National
Socialism” and in various juridical capacities listed in his affidavit
of positions held, Defendant Frank was, between 1933 and 1939, the
most prominent policy-maker in the field of German legal theory.
For example, Defendant Frank founded the Academy of German
Law in 1934 and he was president of this once potent body until
1942. The statute defining the functions of this Academy conferred
upon it wide power to initiate and co-ordinate juridical policies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This statute appears in the translation at Page 5 in the document
book as our Document 1391-PS and appears in the 1934
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> at Page 605. We ask the Court to take judicial
notice of it. I now quote briefly from the decree:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is the task of the Academy for German Law to
further the reorganization of legal procedure in Germany.
Closely connected with the agencies competent for legislation,
it shall further the realization of the National Socialist
program in the realm of the law. This task shall be carried
out by approved scientific methods.</p>
<hr class='tbk156'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Academy’s task shall cover primarily:</p>
<hr class='tbk157'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. The formulation, initiation, judging, and preparing of
drafts of law; 2. collaboration in rejuvenating and unifying
the training in jurisprudence and political science; 3. the
editing and supporting of scientific publications; 4. financial
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
assistance for work and research in specific fields of law and
political economy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Do you have to read all this? We
will take judicial notice of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: Among the early tasks which Defendant
Frank set for himself, as policy-maker in the field of law, were the
unification of the German State, the promotion of racial legislation,
and the elimination of political organizations other than the Nazi
Party. In a radio address given on 20 March 1934 he announced
success in these matters. Our partial English translation of this
speech appears as Document 2536-PS, at Page 64 in the document
book. The official text of this speech appears in <span class='it'>Dokumente der
Deutschen Politik</span>, Volume II (first edition), Pages 294-298. In the
German text the extracts which I shall quote appear at Pages 296
and 298, and I will ask the Court to take judicial notice of these
passages:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The first task was that of uniting all Germans into one
State. It was an outstanding historical and legislative
accomplishment on the part of our Führer that by boldly
grasping historical development he eliminated the sovereignty
of the various German states. At last we have now, after
1,000 years, again a unified German State in every respect. It
is no longer possible for the world, based on the spirit of
resistance inherent in small states, which are set up on an
egoistical scale and solely with a view to their individual
interest, to make calculations to the detriment of the German
people. That is a thing of the past for all times to come.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I pass on now to the second excerpt:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The second fundamental law of the Hitler Reich is racial
legislation. The National Socialists were the first in the
entire history of human law to elevate the concept of race to
the status of a legal term. The German Nation, unified
racially and nationally, will in the future be legally protected
against any further disintegration of the German race stock.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I pass now to the mention of the sixth law:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The sixth fundamental law was the legal elimination of those
political organizations which within the State, during the
period of the regeneration of the people and the reconstruction
of the Reich, were once able to place their selfish aims
ahead of the common good of the nation. This elimination
has taken place entirely legally. It is not the coming to the
fore of despotic tendencies, but it was the necessary legal
consequence of a clear political result of the 14 years’
struggle of the NSDAP.
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk158'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In accordance with these unified legal aims”—Frank
continues—“in all spheres, particular efforts have for months
now been made regarding the work of the great reform of
the entire field of German law.</p>
<hr class='tbk159'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As the leader of the German jurists, I am convinced that,
together with all strata of the German people, we shall be
able to construct the legal state of Adolf Hitler in every
respect and to such an extent that no one in the world will
at any time be able to dare to attack this constitutional state
as regards its laws.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In his speech on the occasion of the day of the Reich University
Professors of the National Socialist Lawyers’ League on 3 October
1936, the Defendant Frank explained to the gathering of professors
the elimination of Jews from the legal field, in accordance with the
Nazi plan. Our partial translation of this speech appears as
Document 2536-PS, at Page 62 of the document book. The official
text appears likewise in <span class='it'>Dokumente der Deutschen Politik</span>, in
Volume IV, Pages 225 to 230. I ask the Tribunal to take judicial
notice of this. It deals, to summarize.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I do not think you need it because we have
already had documents of the same sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: As the leading Nazi jurist, the Defendant
Frank accepted, condoned, and promoted the system of concentration
camps and of arrest without warrant. He apparently had no
hesitancy in subverting his professional ethics, if any he had, while
subverting the legal framework of the German State to Nazi ends.
He explains the outrageous departure from civilization that were
concentration camps in an article on “Legislation and Judiciary in
the Third Reich,” published in 1936 in the official journal of the
Academy of German Law, of which, of course, he was the editor.
The partial translation of this article appears as our Document
2533-PS, at Page 61 of the document book. The official German
text of the extract appears in <span class='it'>Zeitschrift der Akademie für Deutsches
Recht</span>, 1936, at Page 141, and I will ask the Tribunal to take
judicial notice of this. Since the extract is short, I will ask permission
to read it. Frank says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Before the world we are blamed again and again because of
the concentration camps. We are asked: Why do you arrest
without a warrant of arrest? I say: Put yourselves into the
position of our nation. Don’t forget that the very great and
still untouched world of Bolshevism cannot forget that here
on our German soil we have made final victory for them
impossible in Europe.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It can be seen, therefore, that just as other defendants mobilized
the military, economic, and diplomatic resources for aggressive war,
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
the Defendant Frank, in the field of legal policy, geared the German
juridical machine for a war of aggression, which war of aggression,
as he explained in 1942 to the NSDAP political leaders of Galicia
at a mass meeting in Lvov—and I now quote from the Frank diary,
our Document 2233(s)-PS, at Page 50 in the document book, the
original of which I offer in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-607—had
for its purpose, and I quote: “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to expand the living
space for our people in a natural manner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The distortions and warpings of German law, which Defendant
Frank engineered for the Party, gave him, if not the world, vast
satisfaction. He reported this to the powerful Academy for German
Law in November 1939, 1 month after becoming Governor General
of occupied Poland. This speech is partially translated in our Document
3445-PS, at Page 73 in the document book. The official text
of the speech appears in <span class='it'>Deutsches Recht</span>, 1939, Volume 2, the week
of 23-30 December 1939, beginning at Page 2121; and we ask the
Court to take judicial notice of this, but would ask permission to
read the excerpt, as it is very short. Frank stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Today we are proud of having formulated our legal principles
from the very beginning in such a way that they need
not be changed in the case of war. For the maxim—that
which serves the Nation is right, and that which harms it is
wrong, which stood at the beginning of our legal work and
which established this idea of the community of the people
as the only standard of the law—this maxim shines out also
in the social order of these times.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>If this sentiment has a familiar ring to it, it is because it is a
restatement of a Party commandment tailored and furnished by the
Party lawyer to fit the Party’s concept of law. I allude, of course,
to the Party commandment, commented upon at Page 1608
(Volume IV, Page 38) of the official English transcript of these
proceedings in the treatment of the Leadership Corps, which
commandment stated and I quote, “Right is that which serves the
Movement and thus Germany.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It follows, I think, that the Prosecution conceives the Defendant
Frank to be jointly responsible for all those cruel and discriminatory
enabling acts and decrees through which the Nazis crushed
minorities in Germany and consolidated their control over the
German State and prepared it for its early entry upon aggression.
It matters not, in our view, that the signature of this lawyer does
not appear at the foot of every decree. Enough has been shown,
in our submission, to indicate culpability in this regard. There is
sufficient, we believe, now in this Record—and I refer to decrees cited
by Major Walsh in his treatment of the persecution of the Jews and
by Colonel Storey in his treatment of the Reich Cabinet—to
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
demonstrate that type of enactment and the consequences thereof,
for which we hold the Defendant Frank liable. In following this
theory, may it please the Tribunal, we are only arriving at conclusions
already arrived at for us by the Defendant Frank himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now pass to that second and well-known phase of the Defendant
Frank’s official life, wherein he for 5 years, as chief Party
and Government agent, was bent upon the elimination of a whole
people. He was appointed Governor General of the occupied Polish
territory by a decree signed by his then Führer on 12 October 1939.
The decree defined the scope of Frank’s executive power and is
contained in our Document 2537-PS, at Page 66 in the document
book. I shall ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice of this, since
it appears in <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1939, Part I, Page 2077.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It merely states that Dr. Frank is appointed as Governor General
of the occupied Polish territory; that Dr. Seyss-Inquart is appointed
as Deputy Governor General, and that “the Governor General shall
be directly responsible to me”—meaning Hitler, he having signed
the decree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While some of the outside world was prone in earlier days to
wonder at the apparent efficiency of Nazi administration, we now
know that it was often riddled with the petty jealousies of small men
in positions of some authority and with jurisdictional fractiousness.
No such difficulty existed with the Defendant Frank, however, for
though he was not without the threat of divided authority, he insisted
upon, and was granted, the favor of supreme command within
the territorial confines of the Government General. Only two references
from his diary, one in 1940 and one in 1942, are necessary to
show the all-inclusiveness of his direction and authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a meeting of department heads of the Government General
on 8 March 1940 in the Bergakademie, the Defendant Frank clarified
his status as Governor General; and these remarks appear in the
diary and in our Document 2233(m)-PS, at Page 42 in the document
book, the original of which I offer into evidence as Exhibit Number
USA-173.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the German text, the extracts appear in the meetings of
department heads, Volume 2 for 1939-1940, at Pages 5, 6, 7, and
8. Frank says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“One thing is certain. The authority of the Governor General
as the representative of the will of the Führer and the will
of the Reich in this territory is certainly strong, and I have
always emphasized that I would not tolerate misuse of this
authority. I have made this known anew at every office in
Berlin, especially after Herr Field Marshal Göring on 12. 2.
1940, from Karin Hall, had forbidden all administrative offices
of the Reich, including the Police and even the Wehrmacht, to
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
interfere in administrative matters of the Government
General.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>He goes on to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“There is no authority here in the Government General which
is higher as to rank, stronger in influence, and of greater
authority than that of the Governor General. Even the Wehrmacht
has no governmental or official functions here of any
kind; it has only security functions and general military
duties—it has no political power whatsoever. The same applies
to the Police and the SS. There is here no state within
a state, but we are representatives of the Führer and of the
Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Later, in 1942, at a conference of the district political leaders of
the NSDAP in Kraków on 18 March, Defendant Frank further explained
the relationship between the administration and the Reichsführer
SS Himmler. These remarks appear in the diary and in our
Document 2233(r)-PS and at Page 48 of the document book, the
original of which I offer into evidence as Exhibit Number USA-608.
In the German text, the extract to be quoted appears at Pages 185
and 186 of diary Volume 18, 1942, Part I. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As you know”—says Frank—“I am a fanatic as to unity in
administration.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is therefore clear that the Higher SS
and Police Leader is subordinated to me, that the Police is
a component of the Government, that the SS and Police
Leader in the district is subordinated to the Governor, and
that the district chief has the authority of command over the
gendarmerie in his district. This the Reichsführer SS has
recognized; in the written agreement all these points are
mentioned word for word and signed. It is also self-evident
that we cannot establish a closed shop here which can be
treated in the traditional manner of small states.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Do you think all this has to
be read?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: It is considered important, Sir, by the
United States Prosecution, in view of the fact that this is the later
extract from the diary and indicates that 2 years later even Frank
considered himself to be the supreme authority in the Government
General. This is a point which we conceive to be of importance,
Sir. May I proceed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: “It would, for instance, be ridiculous if
we would build up here a security policy of our own against
our Poles in the country, while knowing that the Poles in
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
West Prussia, in Posen, in Warthegau, and in Silesia have
one and the same movement of resistance. So the Reichsführer
SS and Chief of the German Police must be able to carry out,
with his agencies, his police measures concerning the interests
of the Reich as a whole. This, however, will be done in such
a way that the measures to be adopted will first be submitted
to me and carried out only when I give my consent. In the
Government General the Police are the armed forces. Consequently
the leader of the Police will be called by me into the
Government of the Government General; he is subordinate to
me, or to my deputy, as a state secretary for security.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At this juncture, it is appropriate to mention that the man who
filled the position of State Secretary for Security in the Government
General was Frank’s Higher SS and Police Leader, Krüger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you read the next page?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: May it please the Tribunal; I shall come
to that excerpt later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: In the same document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: Yes, Sir. It seems more appropriate at
another point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal may recall that the reports of the extermination
of Jews in the Warsaw ghetto were made in the spring of 1943 by
SS Leader Stroop, who immediately supervised the operation, to
this same Krüger, who was still at that time one of the two most
influential members of Frank’s Cabinet, as State Secretary for
Security.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was inevitable that the grand conspiracy or common plan
should have as its component parts a host of small plans each dealing
with a particular sphere of activity. These plans, differing from
the master plan only in size, are the blueprints for a specific action
drawn from the broad policies. Occupied Poland was no exception
to this rule. The plan for the administration of Poland was contained
in a top secret memorandum of a conference between Hitler
and the Chief of the OKW, Defendant Keitel, entitled “Regarding
Future Relations of Poland to Germany” and dated 20 October 1939.
This report was initialed by General Warlimont. It is our Document
864-PS and may be found at Page 3 of the document book, and I
shall offer it into evidence as Exhibit Number USA-609.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall quote, if the Court please, only from Paragraphs 1, 3, 4,
and 6:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1) The Armed Forces will welcome it if they can dispose
of administrative questions in Poland. On principle, there
cannot be two administrations.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk160'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3) It is not the task of the administration to make Poland
into a model province or a model state of the German order
or to put her economically or financially on a sound basis.</p>
<hr class='tbk161'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Polish intelligentsia must be prevented from forming
a ruling class. The standard of living in the country is to
remain low; we want only to draw labor forces from there.
Poles are also to be used for the administration of the
country. However, the forming of national political groups
may not be allowed.</p>
<hr class='tbk162'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4) The administration has to work on its own responsibility
and must not be dependent on Berlin. We do not want to do
there what we do in the Reich. The responsibility does not
rest with the Berlin Ministries since there is no German
administration unit concerned.</p>
<hr class='tbk163'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The accomplishment of this task will involve a hard racial
struggle which will not allow any legal restrictions. The
methods will be incompatible with the principles otherwise
adhered to by us.</p>
<hr class='tbk164'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Governor General is to give the Polish nation only bare
living conditions and is to maintain the basis for military
security.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk165'/>
<p class='noindent'>“6).&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Any tendencies towards the consolidation of conditions
in Poland are to be suppressed. The ‘Polish muddle’
must be allowed to develop. The Government of the territory
must make it possible for us to purify the Reich territory
from Jews and Poles too. Collaboration with new Reich
provinces (Posen and West Prussia) only for resettlements
(compare Himmler mission).</p>
<hr class='tbk166'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Purpose: Shrewdness and severity must be the maxims in
this racial struggle in order to spare us from going to battle
on account of this country again.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Frank was the chosen executor of this program.
He knew its aims, approved of them, and actively carried out the
scheme. The Tribunal’s attention has already been invited to
Exhibit Number USA-297 wherein—this may be found at Page
1512 of the English text of the official transcript—(Volume III,
Pages 576, 577) the Defendant Frank expounded the mission which
his Führer assigned to him and according to which he intended to
administer in Poland. It contemplated, in brief, ruthless exploitation,
deportation of all supplies and workers, reduction of the
entire Polish economy to an absolute minimum necessary for bare
existence of the population, and the closing of all schools. No more
callous statement exists than the one Frank made in this report,
wherein he said, “Poland shall be treated as a colony; the Poles
shall be the slaves of the Greater German world empire.”
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In December 1940 Frank submitted to his department heads that
the task of administering Poland did truly involve a hard racial
struggle which would not allow any legal restrictions. I refer to
our Document 2233(o)-PS, which may be found at Page 45 in the
document book. It is taken from the Frank diary, and I offer it in
evidence as Exhibit Number USA-173. In the German text the
extract to be quoted appears in the volume of the diary entitled,
“Department Heads Meetings 1939-1940,” on Pages 12 and 13.
I now quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In this country the force of a determined leadership must
rule. The Pole must feel here that we are not building him
a legal state, but that for him there is only one duty, namely,
to work and to behave himself. It is clear that this leads
sometimes to difficulties; but you must, in your own interest,
see that all measures are ruthlessly carried out in order to
become master of the situation. You can rely on me absolutely
in this.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As for the Poles and Ukrainians, Defendant Frank’s attitude
was clear. They were to be permitted to slave for the German
economy as long as the war emergency continued. Once the war was
won, even this cynical interest would cease. I refer to a speech
before German political leaders at Kraków on 12 January 1944.
It appears in the Frank diary and as our Document 2233(bb)-PS at
Page 60 in the document book. It is the first passage on that page.
I offer it in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-295. In the diary,
the German text will be found in the loose-leaf volume covering
the period from 1 January to 28 February 1944, at the entry for
14 January 1944, at Page 24. “Once the war is won” Frank tells
these leaders—and here we have, may it please the Court, the
classic example of the completely brutal statement:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Once the war is won, then, for all I care, mincemeat can
be made of the Poles and the Ukrainians and all the others
who run around here; it doesn’t matter what happens.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In accordance with the racial program of the Nazi conspirators,
the Defendant Frank makes it quite clear in his diary that the
complete annihilation of Jews was one of his cherished objectives.
In Exhibit Number USA-271, Frank stated in late 1940 in his diary
that he could not eliminate all lice and Jews in a year’s time. In
Exhibit Number USA-281, he notes in his diary in the year 1942
that a program of starvation rations sentencing, in effect, 1,200,000
Jews to die of hunger, should be noted only marginally. In
Exhibit Number USA-295, he confided to a secret press conference
that in the year 1944—and this, too, is from the diary—there were
still in the Government General perhaps 100,000 Jews.
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>These facts, if the Tribunal please, are from the diary of the
man himself. We do no more here than to tabulate the results. The
supreme authority within a certain geographic area admits that in
a period of 4 years’ time up to 3,400,000 persons from that area
have been annihilated pursuant to an official policy and for no
crime, but only because of having been born a Jew. No words could
possibly reveal the inferences of death and suffering which must
needs be drawn from these stark facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a Nazi policy that the population of occupied countries
should endure terror, oppression, impoverishment, and starvation.
The Defendant Frank succeeded so well in this regard that he was
forced to report to his Führer in 1943 that, in effect, Poles did not
regard the Government General with affection. This report to Hitler
was a summarization of the first 3½ years of the Defendant Frank’s
administration. It, better than anything else, can show the conditions
as they then existed as a result of the conspiratorial efforts
of the defendants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report is contained in our Document 437-PS, at Page 2 of
the document book, and I now offer the original in evidence as
Exhibit Number USA-610. In the German text, the extract to be
quoted appears at Pages 10 and 11 of this report by Frank to Hitler
dated 19 June 1943, regarding the situation in Poland. I now quote.
Frank says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the course of time, a series of measures, or of consequences
of the German rule, have led to a substantial deterioration
of the attitude of the entire Polish people to the
Government General. These measures have affected either
individual professions or the entire population and frequently
also—often with crushing severity—the fate of individuals.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He goes on:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Among these are in particular:</p>
<hr class='tbk167'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. The entirely insufficient nourishment of the population,
mainly of the working classes in the cities, the majority of
which are working for German interests.</p>
<hr class='tbk168'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Until the war of 1939 their food supplies, though not varied,
were sufficient and were generally assured owing to the
agrarian surplus of the former Polish State and in spite of
the negligence on the part of their former political leadership.</p>
<hr class='tbk169'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. The confiscation of a great part of the Polish estates,
expropriation without compensation, and evacuation of Polish
peasants from maneuver areas and from German settlements.</p>
<hr class='tbk170'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. Encroachments and confiscations in the industries, in commerce
and trade, and in the field of other private property.
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk171'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4. Mass arrests and shootings by the German Police who
applied the system of collective responsibility.</p>
<hr class='tbk172'/>
<p class='noindent'>“5. The rigorous methods of recruiting workers.</p>
<hr class='tbk173'/>
<p class='noindent'>“6. The extensive paralyzing of cultural life.</p>
<hr class='tbk174'/>
<p class='noindent'>“7. The closing of high schools, colleges, and universities.</p>
<hr class='tbk175'/>
<p class='noindent'>“8. The limitation, indeed the complete elimination, of Polish
influence from all spheres of State administration.</p>
<hr class='tbk176'/>
<p class='noindent'>“9. Curtailment of the influence of the Catholic Church,
limiting its extensive influence—an undoubtedly necessary
move—and, in addition, until quite recently, often at the
shortest notice, the closing and confiscation of monasteries,
schools, and charitable institutions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Indeed, the Nazi plan for Poland succeeded all too well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This is only an extract here. Was he saying
that these measures were inevitable or that he justified them, or
what was he saying in the report?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: He was saying, Sir, that the Polish
people’s attitude to the Government General had substantially
deteriorated. The reasons for that deterioration are the listings
I gave to the Court. In other words.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is that all he said?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: No, Sir; that is just taken from Pages 10
and 11 of the report. The report is an extremely long one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I suppose you know what the general
tenor of the report was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: The general tenor of the report, Sir, was
in the nature of a complaint to Hitler, that he, Frank, was having
an extremely difficult time in the Government General because of
these measures and because of these happenings in the Government
General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: In order to illustrate how completely the
Defendant Frank is identified with the policies.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: [<span class='it'>Interposing.</span>] As the Tribunal has already asked
the Prosecution what the purpose of this document is, I would like
to point out here that it concerns a document of 40 typewritten
pages addressed to Hitler and that Frank condemns the conditions
which the Prosecution has brought forward and that in this
document he makes far-reaching proposals to remedy the situation
which he severely criticizes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall, when my turn comes, read the whole document.
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Exactly. You will have full opportunity,
when it is your turn, to explain this document; but it is not your
turn at the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I only mention it now because the Tribunal itself
drew my attention to this point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Now, Lieutenant Colonel Baldwin, I asked
you what was the whole content of the document from which you
were reading this paragraph. According to counsel for Frank, the
document, which is a very long document, shows that Frank was
suggesting remedies for the difficulties which he here sets out. Is
that so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: That is so, Your Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think the.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: May it please the Tribunal, I did not
cite this portion of that document, as I will later demonstrate, to
show that Frank did or did not suggest remedies for these conditions;
but only to explain that these conditions existed as of a
certain period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, when you cite a small part of the
document, you should make sure that what you cite is not misleading
as compared to the rest of the document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: I see, Your Honor. I had not considered
it to be such, in view of the purpose for which I introduced it, which,
as I suggested, was only to indicate a set of conditions which existed
at a certain time. I naturally assumed that the Defense, as Dr. Seidl
has indicated, will carry on with the rest of the document as a
matter of defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, of course, that is all very well, but the
Defendant Frank’s counsel will speak at some remote date; and it
is not a complete answer to say that he will have an opportunity of
explaining the document at some future date. It is for Counsel for
the Prosecution to make sure that no extracts which they read can
reasonably make a misleading impression upon the mind of the
Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: I shall now state, then, that the extract
which was just read was read solely for the purpose of indicating
that at a certain period, namely, June 1943, those conditions existed
in Poland, as the result of statements by the Governor General of
Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would that be satisfactory to the Tribunal?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Well, what is not satisfactory
to the Tribunal is that you did not give us the real purport of the
document.
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: Well, Sir, I don’t have the complete
document before me now. Therefore, I can’t read all of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What we would like, would be, if possible,
that when an extract is made from a document, counsel who are
presenting that extract should instruct themselves as to the general
purport of the document so as to make certain that the part that is
read is not misleading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to illustrate how completely the Defendant Frank is
identified with the policies, the execution of which is reported in
this document, and how thoroughly they were his own policies; and
this, if the Tribunal please, regardless of what remedies he may
have had in 1943, it is proposed in this last section to take passages
from Frank’s own diary in proof of his early espousal and execution
of these self-same policies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the insufficient nourishment of the Polish population, there
was no need for the Defendant Frank to have waited until June
1943 to have reported this fact to Hitler. In September 1941 Defendant
Frank’s own chief medical officer reported to him the appalling
Polish health conditions. This appears in Frank’s diary and in our
Document 2233(p)-PS, at Page 46 in the document book, which I
now offer in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-611. The German
text is to be found in the 1941 diary volume at Page 830. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Chief Medical Adviser Dr. Walbaum expresses his opinion
of the health condition of the Polish population. Investigations
which were carried out by his department proved that the
majority of Poles had only about 600 calories allotted to them,
whereas the normal requirement for a human being was
2,200 calories. The Polish population was weakened to such
an extent that it would fall an easy prey to spotted fever.”—Parenthetically,
I think we know that as typhus.</p>
<hr class='tbk177'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The number of diseased Poles has amounted to date to
40 percent. During the last week alone, 1,000 new spotted
fever cases were officially recorded. That is so far the highest
figure. This health situation represents a serious danger for
the Reich and for the soldiers coming into the Government
General. A spreading of that pestilence into the Reich is very
possible. The increase in tuberculosis, too, is causing anxiety.
If the food rations were to be diminished again, an enormous
increase of the number of illnesses could be predicted.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>While it was crystal-clear from this report that in September
1941 disease affected 40 percent of the Polish population, nevertheless
the Defendant Frank approved, in August 1942, a new plan
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>
which called for a much larger contribution of foodstuffs to Germany
at the expense of the non-German population of the Government
General. Methods of meeting the new quotas out of the
grossly inadequate rations of the Government General and the
impact of the new quotas on the economy of the country were
discussed at a cabinet meeting of the Government General on
24 August 1942 in terms which leave no possible doubt that not only
was the proposed requisition beyond the resources of the country,
but its force was to be distributed on a grossly discriminatory basis.
This appears from Frank’s diary and in our Document 2233(e)-PS,
which is at Page 30 in the document book, which I now offer in
evidence as Exhibit Number USA-283. The German text appears
in the 1942 conference volume at the conference entry for 24 August
1942. I quote the following extract:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Before the German people”—said Frank—“suffer starvation,
the occupied territories and their people shall be exposed to
starvation. In this moment, therefore, we here in the Government
General must have the iron determination to help
the great German people, that is our fatherland.</p>
<hr class='tbk178'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Government General, therefore, must do the following:
The Government General has undertaken to send 500,000 tons
of bread grain to the fatherland in addition to the foodstuffs
already being delivered for the relief of Germany or consumed
here by troops of the Armed Forces, Police, or SS. If
you compare this with our contributions of last year you can
see that this means a six-fold increase over that of last year’s
contribution by the Government General.</p>
<hr class='tbk179'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The new demand will be fulfilled exclusively at the expense
of the foreign population. It must be done cold-bloodedly and
without pity.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Defendant Frank was not only responsible for reducing the
Government General to starvation level, but was proud of the
contribution he thereby made to the Reich. I refer to a statement
made to the political leaders of the NSDAP on 14 December 1942
at Kraków. It is contained in the Frank diary and is our Document
2233(z)-PS, at Page 57 in the document book; and I now offer it
in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-612. In the German text the
extract appears in the 1942 diary volume, Part IV, at Page 1331.
Defendant Frank is speaking:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I will endeavor to get out of the reservoir of this territory
everything that is yet to be had out of it.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>He continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“When you consider that it was possible for me to deliver to
the Reich 600,000 tons of bread grain and in addition 180,000
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
tons to the Armed Forces stationed here; further, an abundance
amounting to many thousands of tons of other commodities,
such as seed, fats, vegetables, besides the delivery to
the Reich of 300 million eggs, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, you can estimate how
important the work in this territory is for the Reich. In order
to make clear to you the significance of the consignment from
the Government General of 600,000 tons of bread grain, you
are referred to the fact that the Government General, by
this achievement alone, covers the raising of the bread ration
in the Greater German Reich by two-thirds for the present
rationing period. This enormous achievement can rightfully
be claimed by us.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, as to the resettlement of Polish peasants which Defendant
Frank mentions secondly in the report to Hitler—although Himmler
was given general authority in connection with the conspirators’
project to resettle various districts in the conquered Eastern territories
with racial Germans, the projects relating to resettling districts
in the Government General were submitted to and approved
by the Defendant Frank. The plan to resettle Zamosc and Lublin,
for example, was reported to him at a meeting to discuss special
problems of the district Lublin by his infamous State Secretary
for Security, Higher SS and Police Leader, Krüger, on 4 August 1942.
It is contained in Frank’s diary and in our Document 2233(t)-PS,
at Page 51 in the document book, which I now offer in evidence as
Exhibit Number USA-607. The German text appears in the 1942
volume of the diary, Part III, Pages 830, 831, and 832.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now quote from the report of the conference:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“State Secretary Krüger then continues, saying that the
Reichsführer’s next immediate plan until the end of the
following year would be to settle the following German racial
groups in the two districts”—Zamosc and Lublin—“1,000
peasant homes (1 homestead per family of about 6) for Bosnian
Germans; 1,200 other kinds of homes; 1,000 homesteads
for Bessarabian Germans; 200 for Serbian Germans; 2,000 for
Leningrad Germans; 4,000 for Baltic Germans; 500 for Wolhynia
Germans; and 200 homes for Flemish, Danish, and
Dutch Germans; in all 10,000 homes for 50,000 to 60,000
persons.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Upon hearing this, the Defendant Frank directed that—and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the resettlement plan is to be discussed co-operatively
by the competent authorities and he declares his willingness
to approve the final plan by the end of September after
satisfactory arrangements had been made concerning all the
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
questions appertaining thereto—in particular the guaranteeing
of peace and order—so that by the middle of November,
as the most favorable time, the resettlement can begin.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn now for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: May it please the Tribunal, the way in
which the resettlement at Zamosc was carried out was described to
Defendant Frank by Krüger at a meeting at Warsaw on January 25,
1943. The report is contained in the Frank diary and is our Document
2233(aa)-PS, and appears at Page 58 in the document book.
I offer the original of it in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-613.
The German text appears in the labor conference volume for 1943,
at Pages 16, 17, and 19. Krüger in this excerpt reports that they
had settled the first 4,000 in the Kreis Zamosc shortly before Christmas;
that, understandably, friends were not made of the Poles in
the resettlement program; and that the Poles had to be chased out.
He then stated to Frank, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We are removing those who constitute a burden in this
new colonization territory. Actually, they are the asocial and
inferior elements. They are being deported; first brought to
a concentration camp and then sent as labor to the Reich.
From a Polish propaganda standpoint, this entire first action
has an unfavorable effect. For the Poles say: ‘After the Jews
have been destroyed, then they will employ the same methods
to get the Poles out of this territory and liquidate them just
like the Jews.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Krüger went on to mention that there was a great deal of unrest
in the territory as a result; and Frank informed him, that is,
Krüger, that each individual case of resettlement would be discussed
in the future exactly as that one of Zamosc had been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the illegality of this dispossession of Poles to make
room for Germans was evident and although the fact that the Poles
who were not only being dispossessed but sent off to concentration
camps became increasingly difficult to handle, the resettlement
projects continued in the Government General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third item mentioned by Frank—the encroachments and
confiscations of industry and private property—was again an early
Frank policy. He explained this to his department heads in December
1939. The report is from his diary and is our Document
2233(k)-PS, and it appears at Page 40 in the document book. I now
offer it in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-173. The German text
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
appears in the department heads conference volume for 1939-40 at
the entry for 2 December 1939 at Pages 2 and 3. Dr. Frank states:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Principally it can be said regarding the administration of
the Government General: This territory in its entirety is
booty for the German Reich, and thus it will not do for this
territory to be exploited in separate individual parts; but the
territory in its entirety shall be economically used and its
entire economic worth redound to the benefit of the German
people.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Reference is made to Exhibit Number USA-297, if any further
support of an early policy of ruthless exploitation is deemed necessary
by the Tribunal. In addition, the decree permitting sequestration
in the Government General heretofore pointed out to the
Tribunal (<span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt für das Generalgouvernement</span>, Number
6, 27 January 1940, Page 23), which decree was signed by the
Defendant Frank, permitted and empowered the Nazi officials to
engage in wholesale seizure of property. This was made the easier
by the undefined criteria of the decree. The looting of the Government
General under this and other decrees has already been
presented to the Tribunal on 14 December 1945, under the subject
heading, “Germanization and spoliation of occupied territories,”
and the Tribunal is respectfully referred to that portion of the
record and in particular to that segment dealing with the Government
General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Frank mentioned mass arrests and mass shooting
and the application of collective responsibility as the fourth reason
for the apparent deterioration of the attitude of the entire Polish
people. In this, too, he is to blame, for it was no part of Defendant
Frank’s policy that reprisal should be commensurate with the
gravity of the offense. He was, on the contrary, an advocate of the
most drastic measures. At a conference of district political leaders at
Kraków, on 18 March 1942, Frank stated his policy. This extract is
from the diary and is our Document 2233(r)-PS and will be found
at Page 49 in the document book. I offer it in evidence as Exhibit
Number USA-608. The German text may be found in the diary
volume for 1942, Part I, Pages 195 and 196. I quote Frank’s statement:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Incidentally, the struggle for the achievement of our aims
will be pursued cold-bloodedly. You see how the state
agencies work. You see that we do not hesitate at anything,
and stand dozens of people up against the wall. This is necessary
because a simple reflection tells me that it cannot be
our task at this period, when the best German blood is being
sacrificed, to show regard for the blood of another race; for
out of this, one of the greatest dangers may arise. One
already hears today in Germany that prisoners of war, for
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
instance, in Bavaria or Thuringia, are administering large
estates entirely independently, while all the men in a village
fit for service are at the front. If this state of affairs continues,
then a gradual retrogression of Germanism will result.
One should not underestimate this danger. Therefore,
everything revealing itself as a Polish power of leadership
must be destroyed again and again with ruthless energy.
This does not have to be shouted abroad; it will happen
silently.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And on 15 January 1944 Defendant Frank assured the political
leaders of the NSDAP that reprisals would be made for German
deaths. These remarks are to be found in the Frank diary, in our
Document 2233(bb)-PS at Page 60 in the document book, the second
quote on that page, the original of which I offer in evidence as
Exhibit Number USA-295. The German text appears in the loose-leaf
volume of the diary covering the period from 1 January 1944
to 28 February 1944, and appears at Page 13. Frank says quite
simply—“I have not hesitated to declare that when a German is
shot, up to 100 Poles shall be shot too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole tragic history of slave-labor and recruitment of
workers has been placed before this Tribunal in great detail. When
the Defendant Frank refers to these methods as his fifth reason for
disaffection in Poland in his report to Hitler, he once more cites
policies which he executed. Force, violence, and economic duress
were all supported by him as means for recruiting laborers for
deportation to slavery in Germany. This was an announced policy,
and I have already alluded to Exhibit Number USA-297, which
contains verification of this fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While in the very beginning recruitment of laborers in the
Government General may have been voluntary, these methods soon
proved inadequate. In the spring of 1940 the question of utilizing
force came up and the matter was discussed at an official meeting
at which the Defendant Seyss-Inquart was also present. I refer
to the Frank diary and our Document 2233(n)-PS, which the
Tribunal will find at Page 43 in the document book. I offer the
original in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-614. The German text
appears in the diary volume for 1940, Part II, at Page 333. I quote
the conference report:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Governor General stated that all means in the form of
proclamations, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, not having succeeded, one is led to
the conclusion that the Poles, out of malevolence and with the
intention of harming Germany by not putting themselves at
its disposal, refuse to enlist for labor service. Therefore, he
asks Dr. Frauendorfer if there are any other measures not as
yet employed to win the Poles on a voluntary basis.
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk180'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Reichshauptamtsleiter Dr. Frauendorfer answered the question
in the negative.</p>
<hr class='tbk181'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Governor General emphasized the fact that he will now
be asked to take a definite attitude towards this question.
Therefore, the question will arise whether any form of
coercive measures should now be employed.</p>
<hr class='tbk182'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The question put by the Governor General to SS Lieutenant
General Krüger as to whether he sees possibilities of calling
Polish workers by coercive means, is answered in the affirmative
by SS Lieutenant General Krüger.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In May 1940, at an official conference—and this record is already
before the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USA-173—Defendant Frank
stated that compulsion in recruitment of labor could be exercised,
that Poles could be snatched from the streets and that the best
method would be organized raids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As in the case of persecution of the Jews, the forced labor program
in the Government General is almost beyond belief. I refer to
the Frank diary and to our Document 2233(w)-PS, which will be
found at Page 53 in the document book, the original of which I offer
into evidence as Exhibit Number USA-607. This excerpt is a record,
if the Court please, of a discussion between the Defendant Sauckel
and the Defendant Frank at Kraków on 18 August 1942; and it
appears in the diary volume for 1942, Part III, at Pages 918 and 920.
Dr. Frank speaks:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I am pleased to report to you officially, Party Comrade
Sauckel, that we have up to now supplied 800,000 workers
for the Reich.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>He continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Recently you have requested us to supply a further 140,000.
I have pleasure in informing you officially that in accordance
with our agreement of yesterday, 60 percent of the newly
requested workers will be supplied to the Reich by the end of
October and the balance of 40 percent by the end of the year.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Dr. Frank continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Beyond the present figure of 140,000 you can, however, next
year reckon upon a higher number of workers from the
Government General, for we shall employ the Police to conscript
them.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>How this recruitment was carried out—by wild and ruthless
manhunts—is clearly shown in Exhibit Number USA-178, which is
in evidence before the Tribunal. Starvation, violence, and death,
which characterized the entire slave-labor program of the conspirators,
was thus faithfully reflected in the administration of the
Defendant Frank.
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>There were, of course, other grounds for uneasiness in occupied
Poland which the Defendant Frank did not mention in his report to
Hitler. He does not mention the concentration camps, perhaps
because as a representative jurist of National Socialism, the Defendant
Frank had himself defended the system in Germany. As
Governor General the Defendant Frank, we feel, must be held
responsible for all concentration camps within the boundaries of
the Government General. These include, among others, the notorious
camp at Maidanek and the one at Lublin and at Treblinka outside
of Warsaw. As indicated previously, the Defendant Frank knew and
approved that Poles were taken to concentration camps in connection
with resettlement projects. He had certain jurisdiction as
well in relation to the extermination camp Auschwitz, to which
Poles from the Government General were committed by his
administration. In February 1944 Embassy Counsellor Dr. Schumberg
suggested a possible amnesty of Poles who had been taken to
Auschwitz for trivial offenses and kept there for several months.
This conference, if the Court please, is reported in the Frank diary
and is contained in our Document 2233(bb)-PS, at Page 60 in the
document book. It is the third quote on that page. I offer the
original in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-295.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You go too fast. Did you say Page 70?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. BALDWIN: Page 60, Sir. The German text appears
in the loose-leaf volume covering the period 1 January 1944 to
28 February 1944, at the conference on 8 February 1944, on Page
7. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Governor General will take under consideration an
amnesty probably for 1 May of this year. Nevertheless, one
must not lose sight of the fact that the German leadership
of the Government General must not now show any sign of
weakness.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This, then, was and is the conspirator Hans Frank. The evidence
is by no means exhausted, but it is our belief that sufficient proof
has been given to this Tribunal to establish his liability under Count
One of the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As legal adviser of Hitler and the Leadership Corps of the
NSDAP, Defendant Frank promoted the conspirators’ rise to power.
In his various juridical capacities, both in the NSDAP and in the
German Government, Defendant Frank certainly advocated and
promoted the political monopoly of the NSDAP, the racial program
of the conspirators, and the terror system of the concentration camps
and of arrest without warrant. His role, early in the Common Plan,
was to realize “the National Socialist program in the realm of the
law” and to give the outward form of legality to this program of
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
terror, persecution, and oppression which had as its ultimate purpose
mobilization for aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a loyal adherent of Hitler and the NSDAP, Defendant Frank
was appointed Governor General in 1939 of that area of Poland
known as the Government General. Defendant Frank had defined
justice as that which benefited the German nation. His 5 years’
administration of the Government General illustrates the most
extreme extension of that principle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been shown that Defendant Frank took the office of
Governor General under a program which constituted in itself a
criminal plan or conspiracy, as Defendant Frank well knew and
approved, to exploit the territory ruthlessly for the benefit of Nazi
Germany, to conscript its nationals for labor in Germany, to close
its schools and colleges, to prevent the rise of a Polish intelligentsia,
and to administer the territory as a colonial possession of the Third
Reich in total disregard of the duties of an occupying power towards
the inhabitants of occupied territory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under Defendant Frank’s administration this criminal plan was
consummated, but the execution went even beyond the plan. Food
contributions to Germany increased to the point where the bare
subsistence reserved for the Government General under the plan
was reduced to a level of mass starvation. The savage program of
exterminating Jews was relentlessly executed. Resettlement projects
were carried out with reckless disregard of the rights of the local
population and the terror of the concentration camp followed in the
wake of the Nazi invaders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This statement of evidence has been compiled in large part from
statements by the Defendant Frank himself, from the admission
found in his diary, official reports, reports of conferences with his
colleagues and subordinates, and his speeches. It is therefore
appropriate that a passage from his diary should be quoted in conclusion.
It is our Document 2233(aa)-PS. It appears at Page 59 in
the document book. I offer the original in evidence as Exhibit
Number USA-613. The German text appears in the 1943 volume of
labor conference meetings at the 25 January 1943 entry on Page 53.
In his address Defendant Frank, prophetically enough, told his
colleagues in the Government General that their task would grow
more difficult. “Hitler”, he said, “could help them only as a kind of
‘administrative pill box.’ ” They must depend on themselves.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We are now duty bound to hold together”—and I quote
Frank—“We must remember that we who are gathered
together here figure on Mr. Roosevelt’s list of war criminals.
I have the honor of being Number One. We have, so to speak,
become accomplices in the world historic sense.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This concludes the presentation on the Defendant Frank.
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>May it please the Tribunal, Lieutenant Colonel Griffith-Jones of
the British Delegation will now deal with the individual responsibility
of the Defendant Streicher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LIEUTENANT COLONEL M. C. GRIFFITH-JONES (Junior Counsel
for the United Kingdom): If the Tribunal please, it is my duty to
present the case against the Defendant Julius Streicher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Appendix A of the Indictment, that paragraph of the Appendix
relating to Streicher, sets out the positions which he held and which
I shall prove. It then goes on to allege that he used those positions
and his personal influence and his close connection with the Führer
in such a manner that he promoted the accession to power of the
Nazi conspirators and the consolidation of their control over Germany,
as set forth in Count One of the Indictment; that he authorized,
directed, and participated in the Crimes against Humanity,
set forth in Count Four of the Indictment, including particularly
the incitement of the persecution of the Jews, set forth in Count One
and Count Four of the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the case against this defendant can be, perhaps,
described by the unofficial title that he assumed for himself as
“Jew-baiter Number One.” It is the Prosecution’s case that for the
course of some 25 years this man educated the whole of the German
people in hatred and that he incited them to the persecution and
to the extermination of the Jewish race. He was an accessory to
murder, perhaps on a scale never attained before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the Tribunal’s permission I propose to prove quite shortly
the position and influence that he held and then to refer the Tribunal
to several short extracts from his newspapers and from his
speeches and then to outline the part that he played in the particular
persecutions that occurred against the Jews between the
years 1933 and 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, perhaps before I start, I might say that the document
book before the members of the Tribunal is arranged in the order
in which I intend to refer to the documents. They are paged and
there is an index at the beginning of the book and if the Tribunal
have got what is called the trial brief, it is in effect a note of the
evidence to which I shall refer and again in the order in which I
shall refer to it, which may be of some assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, this defendant was born in 1885. He became a school
teacher in Nuremberg and formed a party of his own, which he
called the German Socialist Party. The chief policy of that party,
again, was anti-Semitism. In 1922 he handed over his party to
Hitler; and there is a glowing account of his generosity which
appears in Hitler’s <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, which I do not think it worth
occupying the time of the Tribunal in reading. It appears as Document
M-3, and is the first document in the Tribunal’s document book.
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
The copy of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> is already before the Tribunal as Exhibit
GB-128.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The appointments that he held in the Party and State were few.
From 1921 until 1945 he was a member of the Nazi Party. In 1925
he was appointed Gauleiter of Franconia, and he remained as such
until about February of 1940; and from the time that the Nazi
Government came into power in 1933 until 1945, he was a member
of the Reichstag. In addition to that he held the title of Obergruppenführer
in the SA. All that information appears in Document 2975-PS,
which is already exhibited as Exhibit Number USA-9, and is
the affidavit that he made himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The propaganda that he carried out throughout those years was
chiefly done through the medium of his newspapers. He was the
editor and publisher of the paper called Der Stürmer, which was a
weekly journal, from 1922 until 1933; and thereafter the publisher
and owner of the paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1933 he also founded and thereafter, I think, published—certainly
was responsible for—the daily newspaper called the
<span class='it'>Fränkische Tageszeitung</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were, in addition to that and particularly later, several
others, mostly local journals, that he published from Nuremberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those are the positions that he held; and now if I may, I shall
quite briefly trace the course of his incitement and propaganda more
or less in chronological order by referring the Tribunal to the short
extracts. I would say this: These extracts are really selected at
random. They are selected with a view to showing the Tribunal the
various methods that he employed to incite the people against the
Jewish race; but his newspapers are crowded with them, week after
week, day after day. It is impossible to pick up any copy without
finding the same kind of stuff in the headlines and in the articles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I might quote from four speeches and articles showing his early
activities from 1922 until 1933—at Page 3 of the Tribunal’s document
book, Document M-11—that is an extract from a speech that he
made in 1922 in Nuremberg, and—after abusing the Jews in the
first paragraph—I refer only to the last two lines: “We know that
Germany will be free when the Jew has been excluded from the
life of the German people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pass to the next document, which is M-12, on Page 4. The first
document was Exhibit GB-165. That is the book, I understand, that
is being given that number, so that the next document, which is
taken from the same book, will be the same. Perhaps I might be
allowed to read that short extract. It is an extract from a speech:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I beg you and particularly those of you who carry the cross
throughout the land, to become somewhat more serious when
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
I speak of the enemy of the German people, namely, the Jew.
Not out of irresponsibility or for fun do I fight against the
Jewish enemy, but because I bear within me the knowledge
that the whole misfortune was brought to Germany by the
Jews alone.</p>
<hr class='tbk183'/>
<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I ask you once more, what is at stake today? The Jew
seeks domination not only among the German people but
among all peoples. The Communists pave the way for him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Do you not know that the God of the Old Testament ordered
the Jews to devour and enslave the peoples of the earth? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk184'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Government allows the Jew to do as he pleases. The
people expect action to be taken.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You may think about
Adolf Hitler as you please, but one thing you must admit. He
possessed the courage to attempt to free the German people
from the Jew by a national revolution. That was a great
deed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next short extract appearing on the next page is taken from
a speech in April of 1925:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“You must realize that the Jew wants our people to perish.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
That is why you must join us and leave those who have
brought you nothing but war and inflation and discord. For
thousands of years the Jew has been destroying the nations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I ask the Tribunal to note now these last few words:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Let us start today, so that we can annihilate the Jews.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, so far as I have been able to find, that is the earliest
expression of annihilation of the Jewish race. Perhaps it gave birth
to what was 14 years later to become the official policy of the Nazi
Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And one further passage from this period. This is in April 1932,
Document M-14, taken from the same book. He starts by saying,
“For 13 years I have fought against Jewry.” I quote the last paragraph
only:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We know that the Jew, whether he is baptized as a Protestant
or as a Catholic, remains a Jew. Why can you not realize this,
you Protestant clergymen, you Catholic priests! You are
blinded and serve the God of the Jews who is not the God of
love but the God of hate. Why do you not listen to Christ,
who said to the Jews, ‘You are the children of the Devil.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That, then, was the kind of performance he was putting up
during those early years. When the Nazi Party came to power, they
officially started their campaign against the Jews by the boycott
of 1 April 1933. Now, of that boycott the Tribunal have already had
evidence; and I would do no more now than to remind the Tribunal
in a word what happened.
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The boycott was agreed on and approved of by the whole Government,
as was shown in a document which is already before you,
Document 2409-PS, Exhibit Number USA-262, which was Goebbels’
diary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Streicher was appointed the chairman of the central committee
for the organization of that boycott, which appears in Document
2156-PS, Exhibit Number USA-263. It was then said that he started
his work on Wednesday, the 29th.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On that same day the central committee issued a proclamation
in which they said that the boycott would start on Saturday at 10:00
a. m. sharp. “Jewry will realize whom it has challenged.” That short
quotation appears in Document 3389-PS, which is USA-566, which
is a volume—in actual fact, it is a copy of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> which is
already before the Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would refer the Tribunal to one short passage from an article
in the <span class='it'>Nationalsozialistische Partei Korrespondenz</span> which the defendant
wrote on the 30th of March, before the boycott was due to start.
It is Document 2153-PS and appears on Page 12 of the Tribunal’s
book, which becomes Exhibit GB-166. There he writes, under the
title, “Defeat the enemy of the world!—by Julius Streicher, official
leader of the central committee to combat the Jewish atrocity and
boycott campaign.”:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Jewry wanted this battle. It shall have it until it realizes
that the Germany of the brown battalions is not a country of
cowardice and surrender. Jewry will have to fight until we
have won victory.</p>
<hr class='tbk185'/>
<p class='noindent'>“National Socialists! Defeat the enemy of the world. Even if
the world is full of devils, we shall succeed in the end.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As head of the central committee for that boycott, Streicher
outlined in detail the organization of the boycott in orders which
the committee published on the 31st of March 1933, which is the
next document in the book, Document 2154-PS, Exhibit GB-167.
I can summarize those.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The committee stressed that no violence is to be employed
against the Jews on the occasion of that boycott, but not perhaps
for humane reasons; it is because, if there is no violence employed,
then Jewish employers will have no grounds for discharging their
employees without notice; and they will have no ground for
refusing to pay them any wages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Jews were also reported apparently to be transferring
businesses to German figureheads in order to alleviate the results
of this persecution, and the committee laid it down that any
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
property to be transferred was to be considered as Jewish for the
purpose of the boycott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not think I need go into that any further. It does show that
at that date he was taking a leading part, and a leading part as
appointed by the Government, in the persecution of the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would now refer the Court again to a few further extracts to
show the form that this propaganda developed as the years went
on. At Page 18 of the document book, Document M-20, we have
an article in the New Year’s issue of a new paper that he had just
founded. It was a semi-medical paper called <span class='it'>German People’s Health
Through Blood and Soil</span>, edited by himself; and it is an example of
the really remarkable lengths to which he went in putting over
this propaganda against the Jews. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“For the initiated it is established for all time: ‘alien albumen’
is the sperm of a man of alien race. The male sperm in
cohabitation is partially or completely absorbed by the female,
and thus enters her bloodstream. One single cohabitation of a
Jew with an Aryan woman is sufficient to poison her blood
forever. Together with the ‘alien albumen’ she has absorbed
the alien soul. Never again will she be able to bear purely
Aryan children, even when married to an Aryan. They will
all be bastards, with a dual soul and a body of a mixed breed.
Their children, too, will be crossbreeds; that means, ugly people
of unsteady character and with a tendency to illnesses.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk186'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Now we know why the Jew uses every artifice of seduction
in order to ravish German girls at as early an age as possible;
why the Jewish doctor rapes his female patients while they
are under anaesthesia.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He wants the German girl and the
German woman to absorb the alien sperm of the Jew. She is
never again to bear German children!</p>
<hr class='tbk187'/>
<p class='noindent'>“But the blood products of all animal organisms right down
to bacteria, thus serum, lymph, extracts from internal organs,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span>, are also ‘alien albumen.’ They have a poisonous
effect if directly introduced into the bloodstream either by
vaccination or by injection.</p>
<hr class='tbk188'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The worst is that by these products of sick animals the blood
is defiled, the Aryan is impregnated with an alien species.</p>
<hr class='tbk189'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The author and abettor of such action is the Jew. He has
been aware of the secrets of the race question for centuries,
and therefore plans systematically the annihilation of the
nations which are superior to him. Science and ‘authorities’
are his instruments for the enforcing of pseudoscience and the
concealment of truth.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That becomes, My Lord, Exhibit GB-168.
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document, also at the beginning of 1935, an extract
from his own paper <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, is entitled “The Chosen People
of the Criminals”:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“And all the same, or let us say, just because of this, the
history book of the Jews, which is usually called the Holy
Scriptures, impresses us as a horrible criminal romance, which
makes the 150 shilling-shockers of the British Jew, Edgar
Wallace, grow pale with envy. This ‘holy’ book abounds in
murder, incest, fraud, theft, and indecency.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the 4th of October 1935—and the Tribunal will remember
that that was the month after the Nuremberg Decrees had been
made—he made a speech which is reported in the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>
and is entitled in that newspaper, “Safeguard of German
Blood and German Honor.” I read the report in that article: “Gauleiter
Streicher speaks at a German Labor Front mass demonstration
for the Nuremberg laws.” Then the first line of the actual article
says that he spoke for the second time within a few weeks. I quote
only the last two lines of that first large paragraph: “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we have
therefore to unmask the Jew, and that is what I have been doing
for the past 15 years.” That remark apparently was met with
tempestuous applause. That document, M-34, becomes Exhibit
GB-169.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, My Lord, I think it unnecessary to quote from the next
document in the Tribunal’s book. It is very much the same type of
thing. On Page 22 of the document book, Document M-6, there is
a leading article by Streicher in his <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> of which I would
refer only to the last half of the last paragraph where again he
emphasizes the part that he himself has taken in this campaign.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The <span class='it'>Stürmer’s</span> 15 years of work of enlightenment has already
led an army of initiated—millions strong—to National
Socialism. The continued work of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> will help to
ensure that every German down to the last man will, with
heart and hand, join the ranks of those whose aim it is to
crush the head of the serpent Pan-Juda beneath their heels.
He who helps to bring this about helps to eliminate the devil,
and this devil is the Jew.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That document becomes Exhibit GB-170.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document—I include it in the document book again
only to show the extraordinary length to which he went in his
propaganda; and it consists of a photograph of the burning hull of
the airship <span class='it'>Hindenburg</span> when it went on fire in June 1937 in
America. Underneath it the caption includes the comment:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The first radio picture from the United States of America
shows quite clearly that a Jew stands behind the explosion of
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
our airship <span class='it'>Hindenburg</span>. Nature has depicted quite clearly
and quite correctly that devil in human guise.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And although it is not at all clear from that photograph, I think
the meaning of that comment is that the cloud of smoke in the air
is in the shape of a Jewish face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the next page Document M-4 is a speech he made in September
1937 at the opening of a bridge in Nuremberg. I will quote
only the last paragraph on Page 24. The bridge in question is called
the Wilhelm Gustloff bridge, and he says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The man who murdered Wilhelm Gustloff must have come
from the Jewish people, because the Jewish textbooks teach
that every Jew has the right to kill a non-Jew; and indeed,
that it is pleasing to the Jewish God to kill as many non-Jews
as possible.</p>
<hr class='tbk190'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Look at the road the Jewish people have been following for
thousands of years past; everywhere murder, everywhere
mass murder! Neither must we forget that behind present-day
wars there stands the Jewish financier who pursues his
aims and interests. The Jew always lives on the blood of
other nations; he needs such murder and such victims. For
us who know, the murder of Wilhelm Gustloff is the same as
ritual murder.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then on the next page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is our duty to tell the children at school and the bigger
ones what this memorial means.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I go to the next paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Jew no longer shows himself among us openly as he used
to. But it would be wrong to say that victory is ours. Full
and final victory will have been achieved only when the whole
world is rid of Jews.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That becomes Exhibit GB-171.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the next two documents in your document books are simply
extracts from the correspondence columns of his <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>,
showing again one of the methods he employed in this propaganda.
I do not need to read them. The correspondence columns of all his
issues are full of letters coming in from Germans saying that some
German has been buying her shoes from a Jewish shop and so on,
and in that way assisting in the general boycott of the Jews. In
other words, they really are a weekly column of libels against the
Jews all over Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pass then to another and particular form of propaganda that
he employed and which he called “ritual murder.” The Tribunal
may well remember that some years ago—I think it started in 1934—this
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> began publishing accounts of Jewish ritual murder
which horrified the whole world to such an extent that even the
Archbishop of Canterbury eventually wrote to the <span class='it'>Times</span> protesting,
as indeed did people from every country in the world, protesting
that any Government should allow matter like this to be published
in their national newspapers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He takes his ritual murder, I understand, from a medieval belief
that during their Eastertide celebrations the Jews were in the habit
of murdering Christian children; and he enlarges upon this and misrepresents
this belief, this medieval belief, to show that not only
did they do it in the Middle Ages, but that they are still doing it
and still want to do it. And if I might just quote one or two passages
from his newspapers and show one or two pictures which he
published in connection with his campaign of ritual murder, it will
illustrate to the Court the type of teaching and propaganda that he
was putting up. On Page 29 of the Tribunal’s document book, I will
quote from the third but last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This the French front-line soldier should take with him to
France: The German people have taken a new lease on life.
They want peace, but if anybody should attack them, if anyone
should try to torture them again, to throw them back into the
past, then the world would witness another heroic epic; then
may Heaven decide where righteousness lies—here with us,
or where the Jew has the whiphand and where he instigates
massacres, one could almost say the biggest ritual murders of
all times. If the German people are to be slaughtered according
to the Jewish rites, the whole world will be thus
slaughtered at the same time.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Just as you have drummed morning and evening prayers
into your children’s heads, so now drum this into their heads,
so that the German people may gain the spiritual power to
convince the rest of the world which the Jews desire to lead
against us.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That Document is M-2, Exhibit GB-172.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And on the following page of the document book there is a
reproduction of a photograph taken from <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> of April 1937
which illustrates three Jews ritually murdering a girl by cutting
her throat and shows the blood pouring out into a bucket on the
ground. The caption underneath that photograph is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Ritual Murder at Polna. Ritual murder of Agnes Hruza by
the Jews Hilsner, Erdmann, and Wassermann (taken from a
contemporary postcard.)”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is Exhibit Number USA-258. It is already in a copy of
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, which has been put in.
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>There appears on the next page of the document book an extract
from that same <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, April 1937. I will not read it now,
because it has been put in and has all been read to the Court. It
describes what happens when ritual murder takes place, and the
blood is mixed with the bread and drunk by the Jews having their
feast. The Tribunal will remember that during the feast the head
of the family exclaims, “May all gentiles perish—as the child whose
blood is contained in the bread and wine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is already Exhibit Number USA-258, and it has been read
in the transcript at Page 1437 (Volume III, Pages 522, 523).</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would that be a good time to break off?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: If My Lordship pleases.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: May it please the Tribunal, if I
might just refer to two further copies of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> on the subject
of “ritual murder,” the first of which appears on Page 32 of the
document book, 2700-PS. It is the copy in Exhibit USA-260. It is
an article in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> for July 1938:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Whoever has had the occasion to be an eyewitness to the
ritualistic slaughtering of animals or at least to see a truthful
film on this method of slaughtering will never forget this
gruesome experience. It is horrifying. And instinctively he is
reminded of the crimes which the Jews have committed for
centuries on human beings. He will be reminded of the ritual
murder. History offers hundreds of cases in which non-Jewish
children were tortured to death by Jews. They, too, received
the same gash in the throat as is found on ritualistically
slaughtered animals. They, too, were slowly bled to death
while fully conscious.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, on special occasions, or when he had some particular
subject matter to put before the world, he was in the habit of
issuing special editions of his newspaper <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>. Ritual murder
was such a special subject that he issued one of these special editions
dealing solely with it. The Tribunal will have a photostatic copy of
the complete issue for May 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I have not attempted to have translated all, or indeed any,
of the articles which appear in that edition. It is perhaps sufficient
to look at the pictures, the illustrations, and for me to read the
captions which appear underneath the photographs; and I regret
the translations of the captions have not been attached to the Tribunal’s
copy but perhaps I may be permitted to refer to the pictures
and read the captions for the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pages are marked in red pencil on the right-hand corner.
On Page 1 I see a picture of a child having knives stuck into its
side, blood spurting from it, and below the pedestal on which it
stands are five presumably dead children lying on the ground. The
caption to that picture is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the year 1476 the Jews in Regensburg murdered six boys.
They drew their blood and tortured them to death. In an
underground vault which belonged to the Jew Josfol, the
judges found the bodies of the murdered boys. A bloodstained
earthen bowl stood on an altar.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the next page there are two pictures, and the captions explain
them. The one at the top left-hand corner:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“For the Jewish New Year celebrations in 1913, World
Jewry published this picture as a postcard. On the Jewish
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
New Year and on the Day of Atonement the Jews slaughter
a so-called ‘kapores cock,’ that is to say, dead cock, whose
blood and death is intended to purify the Jews. In 1913 the
‘kapores cock’ had the head of the Russian Czar Nicholas II.
By publishing this postcard the Jews intended to say that
Nicholas II would be their next political purifying sacrifice.
On the 16th of July 1918 the Czar was murdered by the Jews
Jurovsky and Goloschtschekin.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The picture at the bottom of the page, again, has a Jew holding
a similar bird:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The ‘kapores cock’ has the head of the Führer. The Hebrew
script says that one day Jews will ‘kill all Hitlerites.’ Then
they, the Jews, will be delivered from all misfortunes. But in
due course the Jews will realize that they have reckoned
without an Adolf Hitler.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next page of the newspaper contains reproductions of a lot
of previous articles on ritual murder, with a picture of the Defendant
Julius Streicher at the top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the fourth page, a picture at the bottom of the right-hand
corner has the caption:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Jew at the Passover Meal. The wine and matzoth,”—unleavened
bread—“contain non-Jewish blood. The Jew
‘prays’ before the meal. He ‘prays’ for death to all non-Jews.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the fifth page are reproductions from some of the European
and American newspaper articles and letters which had been
received by those newspapers during the course of the last years
in protest to this propaganda on the subject of ritual murder, and
in the center of it you will see the letter from the Archbishop of
Canterbury written to the editor of the <span class='it'>Times</span> in protest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the next page, Page 6, is another ghastly picture of a man
having his throat cut—again the usual spurt of blood falling into a
basin on the floor—and the caption to that is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Ritual Murder of the Boy Heinrich. In the year 1345 the
Jews in Munich slaughtered a non-Jewish boy. The martyr
was beatified by the Church.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 7 appears a picture representing three ritual murders.
On Page 8 there is another photo-picture:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“St. Gabriel. This boy was crucified and tortured to death
by the Jews in the year 1690. The blood was drawn from
him.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I think we can pass Page 9 and Page 10.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 11 there is shown a piece of sculpture which appears
on the wall of the Wallfahrts Chapel in Wesel and it represents
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
the ritual murder of a boy, Werner. It is a somewhat disgusting
picture of the boy strung up by his feet and being murdered by
two Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Page 12 reproduces another picture taken from the same place.
The caption is:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Embalmed Body of ‘Simon of Trent’ Who Was Tortured
to Death by the Jews.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 13 has another picture—somebody else having a knife stuck
into him, more blood coming out into a basin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 14 are two pictures. The one at the top is said to be the
ritual murder of the boy Andreas, and the one at the bottom is the
picture of a tombstone, the caption of which reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Tombstone of Hilsner. This is the memorial to a Jewish
ritual murderer, Leopold Hilsner. He was found guilty of two
ritual murders and was condemned in two trials to death by
hanging. The emperor was bribed and pardoned him. Masaryk,
the friend of the Jews, liberated him from penal servitude in
1918. Even on his tombstone lying Jewry calls this two-fold
murderer an innocent victim.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next page again reproduces the picture of a woman being
murdered by having her throat cut in the same way; and perhaps
I might refer to Page 17, which reproduces a picture of the Archbishop
of Canterbury and a picture of an old Jewish man, and the
caption says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Dr. Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Highest
Dignitary of the English Church. His ally, a typical example
of the Jewish race.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The last page, Page 18, reproduces a picture called, “St. Simon
of Trent, Who Was Tortured to Death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it is my submission that that document is nothing
but an incitement to the people of Germany who read it, an
incitement to murder. It is filled with pictures of murder, murder
alleged to be against the German people, and is an encouragement
to all who read it to revenge themselves, and to revenge themselves
in the same way. That document, M-10, becomes Exhibit GB-173.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HANNS MARX (Counsel for Defendant Streicher): The
Defendant Julius Streicher has just called my attention to the fact
that he has not been given the opportunity to prove from where
these pictures, which the Prosecution referred to just now, were
taken. It is, in the opinion of the Defense, necessary that the origin
of these pictures should be made clear to the Tribunal; otherwise
one might think that these pictures had been especially borrowed
for <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> from some obscure source. The Defendant Streicher,
however, points out that these pictures came from recognized
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
historical sources. I should therefore like to suggest that the Prosecution
make this material also available. I think that the articles
of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> which have been referred to must show what the
sources are from which Streicher was supplied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do the articles show the sources? Do the
articles themselves indicate the sources?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I should have said so. There
wasn’t any intention to misrepresent the matter, that these pictures
are taken from original pictures. These were not invented by the
newspaper, and in some cases the sources are shown in the caption.
This is a collection of medieval pictures and frescoes dealing with
this matter. In actual fact the papers show in almost all cases
where they come from.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You have already given us the dates of them,
which indicated they were medieval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: That is so. My Lord, in January
1938—and it will be remembered that in 1938 the persecution of
the Jews became more and more severe—in January 1938, for some
reason or other, another special issue of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> was published.
If the Tribunal would look at Page 34 of their document book I will
quote a short passage from the leading article in that paper—an
article written by the defendant:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The supreme aim and highest task of the State is therefore
to preserve People, Blood, and Race. But if this is the
supreme task, any crime against this law must be punished
with the supreme penalty. <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> takes therefore the
view that there are only two punishments for the crime of
polluting the race: 1. Long-term penal servitude for attempted
race pollution. 2. Death for the completed crime.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And again, indeed if it is now still necessary to show the type
of paper this was, if the Tribunal will turn over to the next page
they will see the headlines set out for some of the articles that
are contained in that edition:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Jewish Race Polluters at Work.”</p>
<hr class='tbk191'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Fifteen-Year-Old Non-Jewess Violated.”</p>
<hr class='tbk192'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A Dangerous Race Polluter. He regards German women as
fair game for himself.”</p>
<hr class='tbk193'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Jewish Sanatorium. A Jewish institution for the cultivation
of race pollution.”</p>
<hr class='tbk194'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Rape of a Feeble-Minded Girl.”
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk195'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Jewish Butler. He steals from his Jewish masters and
commits race pollution.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The copy of that paper is already in as Exhibit USA-260.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the next page of the document book I will quote only the
last two lines. It is an article appearing in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>; and it
is true that it is not an article actually written by the Defendant
Streicher but by his then editor, Karl Holz:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Revenge will break loose one day and will exterminate
Jewry from the face of the earth.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And again on Page 37, in September 1938, <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> has
written an article in which the last two lines read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a parasite, a mischief maker, an evil-doer, a disseminator
of disease, who must be destroyed in the interest of mankind.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is my submission to the Tribunal that this is no longer propaganda
for the persecution of the Jews; this is propaganda for the
extermination of Jews, for the murder not of one man but of
millions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document in the document book, on Page 38, has
already been put in evidence and read to the Tribunal. It is
Exhibit USA-260. It appears in the document book and was read
into the transcript at Page 1438 (Volume III, Page 523). This is
a short article appearing in December 1938, Number 50 of <span class='it'>Der
Stürmer</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would draw the Tribunal’s attention to the next document
which is a picture taken from that same copy. It shows the upper
part of a girl’s body being strangled by the arms of a man with
his hands around her neck and the shadow of the man’s face is
shown against the background, quite obviously with Jewish features.
The caption under that picture is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Castration for Race Polluters. Only heavy penalties will
preserve our womenfolk from a tighter grip from the loathsome
Jewish claws. The Jews are our misfortune.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I pause for the moment from <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> to a particular
incident that occurred, in which the Defendant Streicher took a
leading part. It will be remembered that the organized demonstrations
against the Jews took place the 9th and 10th of November
1938. All this propaganda, as I say, was becoming fiercer and
more ferocious. In the autumn of that year the Defendant Streicher
organized the breaking up of the Nuremberg synagogues on the
occasion of a meeting of press representatives in Nuremberg. That
incident has in fact been referred to previously in this case and
the documents in connection with it are 1724-PS, which were put
in as Exhibit USA-266 and were referred to and read in the
transcript at Page 1443 (Volume III, Page 526).
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Gauleiter Julius Streicher was personally to set the crane
in motion with which the Jewish symbols were to be torn down
from the synagogue. From another document which also was put
in, 2711-PS, which became USA-267, and also was read in the
transcript at Page 1443 (Volume III, Page 526), I quote two lines:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Synagogue is demolished! Julius Streicher himself
inaugurates the work by a speech lasting an hour and a
half. By his order then—so to speak as a prelude of the
demolition—the tremendous Star of David came off the
cupola.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The defendant, of course, took active part in the November
demonstrations of that year. I do not suggest that he was responsible
for the idea of them. The evidence against him is confined
only to the part that he took in his Gau in Franconia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 43 of the document book, Document M-42 is an account
of the Nuremberg demonstrations as they were reported in the
<span class='it'>Fränkische Tageszeitung</span>, which of course was his paper, on the
11th of November. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In Nuremberg and Fürth there were demonstrations by the
crowd against the Jewish murderers. These lasted until the
early hours of the morning. Long enough had one watched
the doings of the Jews in Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then I go to the last three lines of that paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“After midnight the excitement of the populace reached its
peak and a large crowd marched to the synagogues in Nuremberg
and Fürth and burned these two Jewish buildings where
the murder of Germans had been preached.</p>
<hr class='tbk196'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The fire brigades, which had been notified immediately, saw
to it that the fire was confined to the original outbreak.
The windows of the Jewish shopkeepers, who still had not
given up hope of selling their rubbish to the stupid Gojim,
were smashed. Thanks to the disciplined behaviour of the
SA-men and the police, who rushed to the scene, there was
no plundering.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That becomes Exhibit GB-174.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following document in the document book is the report of
Streicher’s speech on the 10th of November, the day of the demonstration.
I will quote from two paragraphs on that page—or rather,
starting in the middle of the first paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“From the cradle the Jew is not taught, as we are, such texts
as ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself’ or ‘Whosoever
shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
also.’ No, he is told ‘With the non-Jew you can do whatever
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
you like.’ He is even taught that the slaughtering of a non-Jew
is an act pleasing to God. For 20 years we have been
writing about this in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>; for 20 years we have
been preaching it throughout the world, and we have made
millions recognize the truth.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I go to the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Jew slaughtered in one night 75,000 Persians; when he
emigrated from Egypt he killed all the first-born, that is, a
whole future generation of Egyptians. What would have
happened if the Jew had succeeded in driving the nations
into war against us, and if we had lost the war? The Jew,
protected by foreign bayonets, would have fallen on us and
would have slaughtered and murdered us. Never forget
what history teaches.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, after the November demonstrations irregularities
occurred in the Gau of Franconia in connection with the organized
Aryanization of Jewish property. Aryanization of Jewish property
was, of course, regulated by the State; and under a decree it had
been laid down that the proceeds, or any proceeds that there might
be, from taking over Jewish properties and giving them to
Aryans—all such proceeds were to go to the State. What apparently
happened in Franconia was that a good deal of the proceeds never
found their way as far as the State, and as a result Göring set up
a commission to investigate what had taken place. We have the report
of that commission, and I would refer the Tribunal to certain short
passages in it. On Page 45, we see from that report exactly what
had been taking place in this Defendant Streicher’s Gau. I quote
from the paragraph, opposite where it says “Page 13”.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: As proof of the irregularities which occurred in
connection with the Aryanization in Nuremberg after the 9th of
November, the prosecutor intends to quote a report which the
Deputy Gauleiter Holz made when he was interrogated before
the examining commission. I wish to protest against making use
of this report. Between Streicher and the Deputy Gauleiter Holz
there existed real tension if not enmity. The Deputy Gauleiter Holz
was the very person responsible for the measures of Aryanization.
It is not at all proved that Streicher had agreed to these measures
being undertaken. It is rather to be assumed that Holz, in order
to cover himself, made statements here which he himself could not
answer for if he were to appear here as witness today. Therefore,
in this report of Holz it is a question of statements made by a man
who was deeply involved in this matter, a man who participated
in these deeds, and a man who was an enemy of the Defendant
Streicher. Holz incriminated Streicher because Streicher did not
protect him in front of the commission and from the then Minister
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
President Göring. Therefore I do not think that this report should
be used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you said what you wished to say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal considers that this document,
being an official document, is admissible under Article 21 and that
the objections which you have made to it are not objections which
go to its admissibility as evidence but go to its weight; and as to
that, you will have an opportunity to develop your objections at a
later stage when you come to speak. The Tribunal rules that the
document is admissible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: My Lord, I read from the center
of that Page 45 of the document book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“After the November demonstrations the Deputy Gauleiter
Holz took up the Jewish question. His reasons can be given
here in detail on the basis of his statement of 25th March 1939:</p>
<hr class='tbk197'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The 9th and 10th of November 1938. During the night of
the 9th to the 10th of November and on the 10th of November
1938, events took place throughout Germany which I”—and
I emphasize that that is Holz speaking—“considered to be the
signal for a completely different treatment of the Jewish
question in Germany. Synagogues and Jewish schools were
burnt down and Jewish property was smashed both in shops
and in private houses. Besides this, a large number of
prominent Jews were taken to concentration camps by the
police. Towards midday we discussed these events in the
Gauleiter’s house. All of us were of the opinion that we now
faced a completely new state of affairs on the Jewish question.
By the great action against the Jews carried out in the night
and morning of the 10th of November all precedents and
all laws on this subject had been made meaningless. We were
of the opinion (particularly I myself) that we should now
act on our own initiative in this respect. I proposed to the
Gauleiter that in view of the great existing lack of housing
the best thing would be to put the Jews into a kind of internment
camp. Then the houses would become free at once; and
the housing shortage would be relieved, at least in part.
Besides that, we should have the Jews under control and
supervision! I added ‘The same thing happened to our
prisoners of war and war internees.’</p>
<hr class='tbk198'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Gauleiter said that this suggestion was for the time
being unfeasible. Thereupon I made a new proposal to him.
I said to him that I considered it unthinkable that, after the
Jews had had their property smashed, they should still be
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
able to own houses and land. I proposed that these houses
and this land ought to be taken away from them, and
declared myself ready to carry through such an action. I
declared that by the Aryanization of Jewish land and houses
a large sum could accrue to the Gau out of the proceeds.
I named some millions of marks. I stated that, in my opinion,
this Aryanization could be carried out as legally as the
Aryanization of shops. The Gauleiter’s answer was something
to this effect: ‘If you think you can carry this out, do so. The
sum gained will then be used to build a Gau school.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I go down now to where it says “Page 18”:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Aryanization was accomplished by the alienation of
properties, the surrender of claims, especially mortgage
claims, and reductions in buying price.</p>
<hr class='tbk199'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The payment allowed the Jews was basically 10 percent of
the nominal value or nominal sum of the claim. As a justification
for these low prices, Holz claimed, at the Berlin meeting
of the 6th of February 1939, that the Jews had mostly bought
their property during the inflation period for less than a
tenth of its value. As has been shown by investigating a
large number of individual cases selected at random, this
claim is not true.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I would turn to Page 48 of the document book, which
appears in the second part of this report, and that part of the
report is really the part containing the findings of the commission.
I quote from the top of the page, Page 48 of the document book .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is this still part of the report?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: This is still part of the report. It
is, in fact, as I say, the findings of the commission.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Gauleiter Streicher likes to beat people with a riding whip
but only if he is in the company of several persons assisting
him. In most cases the beatings are carried out with sadistic
brutality.</p>
<hr class='tbk200'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The best known case is that of Steinruck, whom he beat in
the prison cell until the blood came, together with Deputy
Gauleiter Holz and SA Oberführer König. After returning
from this scene to the Deutscher Hof he said, ‘Now I am
relieved. I needed that again!’ Later he also stated several
times that he needed another Steinruck case in order to
‘relieve’ himself.</p>
<hr class='tbk201'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In August 1938 he beat the editor Burker at the Gauhaus
together with District Office Leader Schöller and his adjutant,
König.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>To show the authority and power that he held in his Gau,
I refer to the last paragraph on that page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“According to reports of reliable witnesses, Gauleiter Streicher
is in the habit of pointing out on the most varied occasions
that he alone gives orders in the district of Franconia. For
instance, at a meeting in the Colosseum in Nuremberg in
1935 he said that nobody could remove him from office.
In a meeting at Herkules Hall, where he described how he
had beaten Professor Steinruck, he emphasized that he would
not let himself be beaten by anybody, not even by an Adolf
Hitler.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk202'/>
<p class='noindent'>“For, this also must be stated here, in Franconia the Gau
acts first and then orders the absolutely powerless authorities
to approve.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, both of those volumes of that report, Document
1757-PS, will become Exhibit GB-175.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal isn’t altogether satisfied that
that has any bearing on the case against Streicher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: My Lord, it is the object of that
document to show the kind of treatment and persecution which
the Jews were receiving in the district or Gau over which this
defendant ruled and, secondly, to show the absolute authority
with which this defendant acted in his district. That is the purpose
of that document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result either of that investigation or of some other matter
the defendant was relieved of his position as Gauleiter in February
1940, but he did not cease from his propaganda or from the control
of his newspaper. I would only quote one further short extract
from <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>. An article written by him on the 4th of November
1943, which appears in the document book on Page 53, is
Document 1965-PS and becomes Exhibit GB-176; and it is an extract
of importance:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is actually true that the Jews have so to speak disappeared
from Europe and that the Jewish ‘Reservoir of the East,’
from which the Jewish pestilence has for centuries beset the
peoples of Europe, has ceased to exist. But the Führer of the
German people at the beginning of the war prophesied what
has now come to pass.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, that article was signed by Streicher, and it is my submission
that it shows that he had knowledge of what was going
on in the East, of which this Court has had such evidence. That
was written November 1943. In April ’43, the Tribunal will remember,
the Warsaw ghetto was destroyed. Between April 1942 and
April 1944, 1,700,000-odd Jews were killed in Auschwitz and Dachau—I
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
quote now from the transcript—and throughout the whole of
that period millions of Jews were to die. It is my submission that
that article appearing on the 4th of November and signed by him
shows that he knew what was happening, perhaps not the details,
but that he knew that the Jews were being exterminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I leave <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> and I would draw the attention of the
Tribunal quite shortly to a matter which is perhaps as evil as any
other aspect of this man’s activity, and that is the particular attention
that he paid to the instruction—if you can call it that—or the
perversion of the children and the youth of Germany. He was not
content with inciting the German population. He seized the children
as early as he could at their schools, and he started to poison their
minds at the earliest possible date. Already in some of the extracts
to which I have referred, the Tribunal will remember that there are
mentions of children and the need for teaching them anti-Semitism.
I refer now to Page 54 of the document book, and I would quote
four or five lines from the last paragraph, starting in the middle of
the last paragraph. It is a report of a speech by Streicher as early
as June 1925, when he says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I repeat, we demand the transformation of the school into an
ethno-German institution of education. If German children
are taught by German teachers, then we shall have laid the
foundations for the ethno-German school. This ethno-German
school must teach racial doctrine.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now go to the last line of the first paragraph on the following
page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We demand, therefore, the introduction of racial doctrine
into the school.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is in a copy of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> which has already been put in.
It is Exhibit GB-165 (Document M-30).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following Document, M-43, is an extract from the <span class='it'>Fränkische
Tageszeitung</span> of the 19th of March 1934, when he addressed the
pupils at a girls’ school at Preisslerstrasse after their finishing their
vocational course. He was continually holding children’s meetings
and attending children’s schools. I quote the third paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Then Julius Streicher spoke about his life and told them
about a girl who had at one time been a pupil of his and who
had fallen a victim to a Jew and was finished for the rest of
her life.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I need not read the rest. It is all in the same tone. That becomes
Exhibit GB-177.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every summer they celebrated in Nuremberg what they called
their solstice celebration, some pagan rite where the youth of
Nuremberg rallied—organized or at least encouraged by the Defendant
Streicher.
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 58 of the document book is a report taken from his
paper, <span class='it'>Fränkische Tageszeitung</span>, of his speech to the Hitler Youth
on what they called the “Holy Mountain” near Nuremberg, on the
22d of June 1935.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Boys and girls, look back a little more than 10 years ago.
A great war—the World War—had raged over the peoples of
the earth and had left in the end a heap of ruins. Only one
people remained victorious in that dreadful war, a people of
whom Christ said that its father is the Devil. That people
had ruined the German Nation in body and soul. At that time
Adolf Hitler, an unknown man, arose from among the people
and became a voice which proclaimed a holy war and
struggle. He cried to the people to take courage again and
to rise and join in liberating the German people from the
Devil, so that mankind might again be free from that race
which has roamed the globe for centuries and millennia,
marked with the brand of Cain.</p>
<hr class='tbk203'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Boys and girls, even if it is said that the Jews were once the
chosen people do not believe it, but believe us when we say
that the Jews are not a chosen people. Because it cannot be
that a chosen people should act among the peoples as the
Jews do today.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And so on, with similar kind of propaganda. That Document, M-1,
will be Exhibit GB-178.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next Document, M-44, from which I will not read now,
becomes Exhibit GB-179. The Tribunal will see that it was a report
of Streicher’s address to 2,000 children at Nuremberg at Christmastime
1936. Underlined it says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“ ‘<span class='it'>Do you know who the Devil is?</span>’ he asked his breathlessly
listening audience. ‘The Jew, the Jew,’ resounded from a
thousand children’s voices.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But he wasn’t content only with writing and talking. He actually
issued a book for teachers, a book which he published from his <span class='it'>Der
Stürmer</span> offices, called <span class='it'>The Jewish Question and School Instruction</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have not had the whole of that book translated. It is addressed
to school teachers. It is intended for their benefit, and it emphasizes
the necessity of anti-Semitic teaching in schools, and it suggests
ways in which the subject can be introduced and handled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 60 of the document book, M-46, the Tribunal will see
a few extracts which have been taken from that book. The preface
part of it is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The National Socialist State has brought fundamental changes
into all spheres of life of the German people.
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk204'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It has also presented the German teacher with new duties.
The National Socialist State demands that its teachers instruct
German children on racial questions. As far as the German
people is concerned the racial question is a Jewish question.
Those who want to teach the child about the Jew must
themselves have a thorough knowledge of the subject.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I will quote from the paragraph opposite “Page 5” in the margin.
The whole of the rest of the extracts are really suggestions for
teachers as to how to introduce the Jewish subject into their
teaching, and at Page 5 of the introduction:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Racial and Jewish questions are the fundamental problems
of the National Socialist ideology. The solution of these
problems will secure the existence of National Socialism and
with this the existence of our nation for all time. The
enormous significance of the racial question is recognized
almost without exception today by all the German people. In
order to come to this realization, our people had to travel
through a long road of suffering.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I should like to point out the following: The prosecutor
omitted in his presentation to state that the book he referred
to was not written by the Defendant Streicher but by the school
inspector Fink. If the prosecutor had read the next sentence, the
Tribunal would have known about this fact. My client has called
my attention to this point. I noticed it myself also because the next
sentence reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Schulrat Fritz Fink desires to help German teachers on the
road to information and knowledge with his book: <span class='it'>The Jewish
Question in the Schools</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There can thus be no doubt that this School Inspector Fink is the
author of the book. It is, after all, an essential thing to know that
Fink and not Streicher was the author of this book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you finished what you wish to say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes; that is what I wanted to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I would point out to you that although the
book does appear to have been written by Fritz Fink, which is
stated in the paragraph at the top, it has a preface by Streicher, so
we may presume that Streicher authorized it; and it was published
and printed by <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: That is correct. I just wanted to point out to the
Tribunal that it did not appear to be understood, that just that
particular sentence was not read. One might have thought that an
original work of Streicher’s was concerned, in which case the
question of whether Streicher agreed with that work would appear
of minor importance.
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But you see, Dr. Marx, counsel was reading
actually from the preface by Streicher. The last passage that he
read, or almost the last, was the preface by Streicher. The last
passage I have got marked is the passage on Page 60, which is
headed “Preface” and is signed by Julius Streicher, which says in
terms that the book was written by School Inspector Fritz Fink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us not take any further time about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I think I have reached.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you read the last words of that preface
on Page 60 there: “Those who take to heart .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: If Your Lordship pleases, I read
towards the end of the paragraph—the first paragraph of the
preface:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Those who take to heart all that has been written with such
feeling by Fritz Fink, who for many years has been greatly
concerned about the German people, will be grateful to the
creator of this outwardly insignificant publication.”—Then it
is signed—“Julius Streicher, City of the Reich Party rallies,
Nuremberg, in the year 1937.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I omitted that last part only in the interest of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: That book is Exhibit GB-180. I
would just read the last two lines, which I was not able to read
before Dr. Marx interposed. The last three lines of the paragraph
under “Introduction”:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“No one should be allowed to grow up in the midst of our
people without this knowledge of the frightfulness and
dangerousness of the Jew.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I will not occupy the time of the Tribunal by reading further
from that book. The nature of the book I hope is clear. I would
only refer to the last three lines on the next page in the document
book, taking another extract from it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“One who has reached this stage of understanding will inevitably
remain an enemy of the Jews all his life and will
instill this hatred into his own children.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> also published some children’s books, although I
make it quite clear that I am not alleging that the defendant himself
wrote the books. But they were published from his publishing
business; and they are, of course, on the same line as everything
else that was published and issued from that business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first of them to which I would call attention was entitled in
English—or the English translation is—as follows: Don’t Trust the
Fox in the Green Meadow Nor the Jew on His Oath. It is a picture
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
book for children. There are pictures, all of them offensive pictures
depicting Jews, of which a variety of selections appears in the
Tribunal’s book. And opposite each picture there is a little story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 62 of the document book the Tribunal will see the kind
of thing which appears opposite each picture. Opposite the picture
in the Tribunal’s document book appears the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Jesus Christ says, ‘The Jew is a murderer through and
through.’ And when Christ had to die the Lord didn’t know
of any other people that would torture him to death, so he
chose the Jews. That is why the Jews pride themselves on
being the chosen people.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The writing opposite the first picture, which depicts a very
unpleasant looking Jewish butcher cutting up meat, is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Jewish butcher: He sells half-refuse instead of meat. A
piece of meat lies on the floor, the cat claws another. This
doesn’t worry the Jewish butcher since the meat increases in
weight. Besides, one mustn’t forget, he won’t have to eat it
himself.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Again in the interest of time, it is not worth quoting the contents
of that book any further. The Tribunal can see the type of book it
is, the type of teaching it was instilling into the minds of the
children. The pictures speak for themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second picture is a rather beastly picture of a girl being led
away by a Jew. On the next page we see the defendant smiling
benignly at a children’s party, greeting the little children. The next
picture depicts copies of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> posted on a wall with children
looking at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next picture perhaps requires a little explanation. It is a
picture of Jewish children being taken away from an Aryan school,
led away by an unpleasant looking father; and all the Aryan
children shouting and dancing and enjoying the fun very much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That book, Document M-32, becomes Exhibit GB-181.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You won’t be able, will you, to finish in a
short time? Perhaps we’d better adjourn now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I have about another 20 minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Oh, yes; we will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: My Lord, I had finished describing
that one children’s book. There is a similar book called <span class='it'>The
Poisonous Fungus</span>, which has, in fact, been put in evidence already
as Exhibit USA-257, but it was not read to the Tribunal; and I
would like to read one of the short stories from that book because
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
it shows, perhaps more strikingly, I think, than any other extract
to which we have referred, the revolting way in which this man
poisoned the minds of his listeners and readers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a book of pictures again with short stories, and Page 69 of
the document book shows one of the pictures, a girl sitting in a
Jewish doctor’s waiting room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it is not a very pleasant story, but he is not a very
pleasant man; and it is only by reading these things that it becomes
possible to believe the kind of education that the German children
have been receiving during these years, led by this man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I quote from the story:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Inge”—that is the girl—“Inge sits in the reception room of
the Jew doctor. She has to wait a long time. She looks
through the journals which are on the table. But she is much
too nervous to read even a few sentences. Again and again
she remembers the talk with her mother. And again and
again her mind reflects on the warnings of her leader of the
League of German Girls. A German must not consult a Jew
doctor. And particularly not a German girl. Many a girl that
went to a Jew doctor to be cured met with disease and disgrace.</p>
<hr class='tbk205'/>
<p class='noindent'>“When Inge had entered the waiting room, she experienced an
extraordinary incident. From the doctor’s consulting room
she could hear the sound of crying. She heard the voice of a
young girl, ‘Doctor, doctor, leave me alone.’</p>
<hr class='tbk206'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Then she heard the scornful laughter of a man. And then,
all of a sudden it became absolutely silent. Inge had listened
breathlessly.</p>
<hr class='tbk207'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘What can be the meaning of all this?’ she asked herself, and
her heart was pounding. And again she thought of the
warning of her leader in the League of German Girls.</p>
<hr class='tbk208'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Inge had already been waiting for an hour. Again she takes
the journals in an endeavor to read. Then the door opens.
Inge looks up. The Jew appears. She screams. In terror she
drops the paper. Horrified she jumps up. Her eyes stare into
the face of the Jewish doctor. And this face is the face of the
Devil. In the middle of this devil’s face is a huge crooked
nose. Behind the spectacles gleam two criminal eyes. Around
the thick lips plays a grin, a grin that means, ‘Now I have
you at last, you little German girl!’</p>
<hr class='tbk209'/>
<p class='noindent'>“And then the Jew approaches her. His fat fingers snatch at
her. But now Inge has got hold of herself. Before the Jew
can grab hold of her, she smacks the fat face of the Jew
doctor with her hand. One jump to the door. Breathlessly
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
Inge runs down the stairs. Breathlessly she escapes from the
Jew house.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Comment is almost unnecessary on a story like that, read by
children of the age of those who are going to read the books you
have seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another picture which I have included in the book is a picture,
of course of the defendant, and the script opposite that picture,
which appears on Page 70 of the document book, includes the
words—and I quote from the last but one paragraph: “Without a
solution of the Jewish question there will be no salvation for
mankind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The page itself contains an account of how some boys attended
one of his speeches:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“That is what he shouted to us. We all understood him. And
when, at the end, he shouted, ‘Sieg-Heil for the Führer,’ we
all acclaimed him with tremendous enthusiasm. Streicher
spoke for two hours that time. To us it seemed to have been
but a few minutes.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>One can begin to see the effect that all this was having from the
columns of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> itself. In April 1936 there appears only
one letter—many others appear in other copies from children of all
ages—I quote the third paragraph of this letter, the letter signed
by the boys and girls of the National Socialist Youth Hostel at
Gross-Möllem:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Today we saw a play on how the Devil persuades the Jew
to shoot a conscientious National Socialist. In the course of
the play the Jew did it, too. We all heard the shot. We would
have all liked to jump up and arrest the Jew. But then the
policeman came and after a short struggle took the Jew along.
You can imagine, dear <span class='it'>Stürmer</span>, that we heartily cheered the
policeman. In the whole play not one name was mentioned,
but we all knew that this play represented the murder by the
Jew Frankfurter. We were very sad when we went to bed
that night. None felt like talking to the others. This play
made it clear to us how the Jew sets to work.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>My Lord, that book is already in evidence as I have stated. It is
Exhibit GB-170 (Document M-25).</p>

<p class='pindent'>To conclude, I would draw the attention of the Tribunal again
only to his authority as a Gauleiter. It appears in the <span class='it'>Organization
Book of the NSDAP</span> for 1938—which is already in as Exhibit
USA-430—in the description of the duties and authority of Gauleiter:
The Gauleiter bears over-all responsibility to the Führer for
the sector of sovereignty entrusted to him. The rights, duties, and
jurisdiction of the Gauleiter result primarily from the mission
assigned by the Führer and, apart from that, from detailed direction.
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>His association with the Führer and with the other defendants—or
some of the other defendants—can be seen from the newspapers.
On the occasion of his 50th birthday Hitler paid a visit to Nuremberg
to congratulate him. That was on the 13th of February 1935.
The account of that meeting is published in the <span class='it'>Völkischer
Beobachter</span> of that date, and I quote as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Adolf Hitler spoke to his old comrade in arms and the
latter’s followers in words which went straight to their
hearts. By way of introduction he remarked that it was a
special pleasure for him to spend, on this day of honor to
Julius Streicher, a short while in Nuremberg, the town of
battle-steeled National Socialist solidarity, within the circle
of the veteran standard-bearers of the National Socialist idea.</p>
<hr class='tbk210'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Just as they all, during the years of misery, had unshakeably
believed in the victory of the Movement, so his friend and
comrade in arms, Streicher, had stood faithfully at his side
at all times. It had been this unshakeable belief that had
moved mountains.</p>
<hr class='tbk211'/>
<p class='noindent'>“For Streicher it would surely be an inspiring thought that
this 50th anniversary meant to him not only the turn of a
half century, but also of a thousand years of German
history. He had in Streicher a comrade of whom he could
say that here in Nuremberg was a man who would never
waver for a single second and who would unflinchingly stand
behind him in every situation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is Document M-8 and becomes Exhibit GB-182.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document (M-22) is a letter from Himmler published
in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> of April 1937. That edition is already Exhibit
USA-258.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“When in future years the history of the reawakening of the
German people is written and the next generation is already
unable to understand that the German people were once
friendly to the Jews, it will be recognized that Julius
Streicher and his weekly paper <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> contributed
a great deal toward the enlightenment regarding the enemy
of mankind.”—Signed—“The Reichsführer SS, H. Himmler.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is Exhibit USA-258. A number of these documents are
already in evidence in the bound volumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lastly, we have a letter from Baldur von Schirach, the Reich
Youth Leader, published in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> of March 1938 (Document
M-45, Exhibit USA-260):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is the historical merit of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> to have enlightened
the broad masses of our people in a popular way as to
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
the Jewish world danger. <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> is right in not carrying
out its task in a purely aesthetic manner, for Jewry
has shown no regard for the German people. We have,
therefore, no reason for being considerate toward our worst
enemy. What we fail to do today, the youth of tomorrow
will have to suffer for bitterly.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it may be that this defendant is less directly involved
in the physical commission of the crimes against Jews, of which
this Tribunal have heard, than some of his co-conspirators. The
submission of the Prosecution is that his crime is no less the worse
for that reason. No government in the world, before the Nazis
came to power, could have embarked upon and put into effect a
policy of mass extermination in the way in which they did, without
having a people who would back them and support them and
without having a large number of people, men and women, who
were prepared to put their hands to their bloody murder. And
not even, perhaps, the German people of previous generations
would have lent themselves to the crimes about which this Tribunal
has heard, the killing of millions and millions of men and women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was to the task of educating the people, of producing murderers,
educating and poisoning them with hate, that Streicher
set himself; and for 25 years he has continued unrelentingly the
education—if you can call it so—or the perversion of the people
and of the youth of Germany. And he has gone on and on as
he saw the results of his work bearing fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the early days he was preaching persecution. As persecutions
took place he preached extermination and annihilation; and, as
we have seen in the ghettos of the East, as millions of Jews were
being exterminated and annihilated, he cried out for more and
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is the crime that he has committed. It is the submission of
the Prosecution that he made these things possible—made these
crimes possible—which could never have happened had it not been
for him and for those like him. He led the propaganda and the
education of the German people in those ways. Without him the
Kaltenbrunners, the Himmlers, the General Stroops would have had
nobody to carry out their orders. And, as we have seen, he has concentrated
upon the youth and the childhood of Germany. In its
extent his crime is probably greater and more far-reaching than
that of any of the other defendants. The misery that they caused
finished with their incarceration. The effects of this man’s crime, of
the poison that he has injected into the minds of millions and
millions of young boys and girls and young men and women lives
on. He leaves behind him a legacy of almost a whole people
poisoned with hate, sadism, and murder, and perverted by him.
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
That German people remains a problem and perhaps a menace to
the rest of civilization for generations to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I submit that the Prosecution’s case against this man
as set out in the Indictment is proved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, Lieutenant Brady Bryson, of the United States Delegation,
will present to the Court the case against Schacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LIEUTENANT BRADY O. BRYSON (Assistant Trial Counsel for
the United States): May it please the Tribunal, a document book has
been prepared and filed and the appropriate number of copies has
been delivered to the defendants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We ask the Tribunal’s permission to file within the next few
days a trial brief which now is in the process of preparation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our proof against the Defendant Schacht is confined to planning
and preparation of aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What was it you said about the trial brief?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: We ask permission to file a trial brief within the
next few days, as our brief is not yet ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: Our proof against the Defendant Schacht is
limited to planning and preparation for aggressive war and to
membership in a conspiracy for aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The extent of Schacht’s criminal responsibility as a matter of
law, under the Charter of the Tribunal, will be developed in our
brief. Only a few of our 50-odd documents have been previously
submitted in evidence. We have taken special pains to avoid repetition
and cumulative proof; but for the sake of continuity we
would like, in several instances, simply to draw the Tribunal’s
attention to evidence previously received, with an appropriate reference
to the transcript of the Record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before commencing our proof, we wish to state our understanding
that the Defendant Schacht’s control over the German
economy was on the wane after November 1937, and that by the
time of the aggression on Poland his official status had been
reduced to that of Minister without Portfolio and personal adviser
to Hitler. We know too that he is sometimes credited with opposition
to certain of the more radical elements of the Nazi Party;
and I further understand that at the time of capture by United
States forces he was under German detention in a prison camp,
having been arrested by the Gestapo in July 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Be this as it may, our proof will show that at least up until the
end of 1937 Schacht was the dominant figure in the rearming of
Germany and in the economic planning and preparation for war, that
without his work the Nazis would not have been able to wring from
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
their depressed economy the tremendous material requirements of
armed aggression, and that Schacht contributed his efforts with full
knowledge of the aggressive purposes which he was serving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The details of this proof will be presented in four parts:</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, we will very briefly show that Schacht accepted the Nazi
philosophy prior to 1933 and supported Hitler’s rise to power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Second, proof of the contribution of Schacht to German rearmament
and preparation for war will be submitted. This evidence will
also be brief, since the facts in this respect are well-known and
have already been touched upon by Mr. Dodd in his presentation of
the case on economic preparation for war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Third, we will show that Schacht assisted the Nazi conspiracy
purposely and willingly with knowledge of, and sympathy for, its
illegal ends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And last, we will prove that Schacht’s loss of power in the
German Government did not in any sense imply disagreement with
the policy of aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We turn now to our proof that Schacht helped Hitler to power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht met Göring for the first time in December 1930, and
Hitler early in January 1931 at Göring’s house. His impression of
Hitler was favorable. I offer in evidence Exhibit USA-615 (Document
3725-PS), consisting of an excerpt from a pre-trial interrogation
of Schacht under date of 20 July 1945, and quote two questions
and answers related to this meeting, near the middle of the first
page of the interrogation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you going to give us the Exhibit
number? You haven’t given us the other number?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: This is an interrogation, Sir, and it will not have
two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you got a number for it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: You will find it in your document book in the
back, labeled “Schacht Interrogation of 20 July 1945.” I quote from
the middle of the first page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘What did he’ ”—that is, Hitler—“ ‘say?’</p>
<hr class='tbk212'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘Oh, ideas he expressed before, but it was full of will
and spirit.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And near the bottom of the page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘What was your impression at the end of that evening?’</p>
<hr class='tbk213'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘I thought that Hitler was a man with whom one could
co-operate.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After this meeting Schacht allied himself with Hitler; and at a
crucial political moment in November 1932, he lent the prestige of
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
his name, which was widely known in banking, financial, and business
circles throughout the world, to Hitler’s cause. I offer in
evidence Exhibit USA-616 (Document 3729-PS) consisting of
excerpts from a pre-trial interrogation of Schacht on 17 October
1945. I wish to quote, beginning at the top of Page 36 of this interrogation.
This is the interrogation of 17 October 1945, at Page 36. I
may say that when I refer to the page numbers, I speak of the
page of the document book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Yes, and at that time’ ”—referring to January 1931—“ ‘you
became a supporter, I take it, of.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>
<hr class='tbk214'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘In the course.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>
<hr class='tbk215'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Of Hitler’s coming to power?’</p>
<hr class='tbk216'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘Especially in the course of the years 1931 and 1932.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And I quote further from the lower half of Page 37 of the same
interrogation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘But what I mean—to make it very brief—did you lend
the prestige of your name to help Hitler come to power?’</p>
<hr class='tbk217'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘I have publicly stated that I expected Hitler to come to
power; for the first time, if I remember, in November ’32.’</p>
<hr class='tbk218'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘And you know, or perhaps you don’t, that Goebbels in
his diary records with great affection.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>
<hr class='tbk219'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘Yes.’</p>
<hr class='tbk220'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the help that you gave him at the time?’</p>
<hr class='tbk221'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘Yes, I know that.’</p>
<hr class='tbk222'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘November 1932?’</p>
<hr class='tbk223'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘From the Kaiserhof to the Chancellery and back.’</p>
<hr class='tbk224'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘That’s right. You have read that?’</p>
<hr class='tbk225'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘Yes.’</p>
<hr class='tbk226'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘And you don’t deny that Goebbels was right?’</p>
<hr class='tbk227'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘I think his impression was that that was correct at that
time.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now refer the Tribunal to this statement of Goebbels, set forth
in 2409(a)-PS. The entire diary of Goebbels is in evidence as
Exhibit Number USA-262. The entry I wish to read, which appears
in 2409(a)-PS, was made on 21 November 1932:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In a conversation with Dr. Schacht I assured myself that he
absolutely shares our point of view. He is one of the few
who stand immovable behind the Führer.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is believed that Schacht joined the Party only in the sense that
he allied himself with the cause. Dr. Franz Reuter, whose biography
of Schacht was officially published in Germany in 1937, has
stated that Schacht refrained from formal membership in order to
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
be of greater assistance to the Party. I offer in evidence Document
Number EC-460, Exhibit Number USA-617, consisting of an excerpt
from Reuter’s biography, and I quote the last sentence of the
excerpt:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“By not doing so, he was able eventually to help more toward
the final victory than if he had become an enrolled Party
member.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was Schacht who organized the financial means for the decisive
March 1933 election, at a meeting of Hitler with a group of
German industrialists in Berlin. Schacht acted as the sponsor or
host of this meeting, and a campaign fund of several million marks
was collected. Without reading therefrom, I offer in evidence Document
Number EC-439, Exhibit Number USA-618, an affidavit of
Von Schnitzler under date of 10 November 1945, and refer the Tribunal
to the transcript for 23 November, Pages 282-283 (Volume II,
Pages 223, 224), where the text of the affidavit already appears in
the Record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further evidence on this point is also contained in the excerpt
from the interrogation of Schacht on 20 July 1945, from which I
read a part a moment ago. Schacht lent his support to Hitler not
only because he was an opportunist, but also because he shared
Hitler’s ideological principles. Apart from the entry in Goebbels’
diary, this may be seen from Schacht’s own letter to Hitler, under
date of 29 August 1932, pledging continued support to Hitler after
the latter’s poor showing in the July 1932 elections. I offer this
letter in evidence as Document Number EC-457, Exhibit Number
USA-619, and quote from the middle of the first paragraph and
further from the next to the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“But what you could perhaps do with in these days is a kind
word. Your movement is carried internally by so strong a
truth and necessity that victory in one form or another cannot
elude you for long.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And further down—and keep in mind that neither Hitler nor
Schacht was then in the German Government—Schacht says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Wherever my work may take me in the near future, even if
you should see me one day behind stone walls, you can
always count on me as your reliable assistant.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What do those words mean at the top: “The
President of the Reichsbank in Retirement”? Are they on the letter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: Yes, they are, Sir. Dr. Schacht had previously
been a president of the Reichsbank. At this time he was in retirement.
You will remember, this is prior to Hitler’s accession to power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, of course.
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: And then Hitler reinstated Dr. Schacht as President
of the Reichsbank after the Nazis had taken over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And he put that at the top of his letter, did
he?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: That I cannot say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will also point out that Schacht signed this letter, “With a
vigorous Heil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We turn now to the second part of our proof, relating to
Schacht’s contribution to preparation for war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The detailed chronology of Schacht’s official career in the Nazi
Government, as set forth in Document 3021-PS, has already been
submitted in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-11. However, it may
be helpful at the outset to remind the Tribunal that Schacht was
recalled to the Presidency of the Reichsbank by Hitler on 17 March
1933, which office he continuously held until 20 January 1939; that
he was Acting Minister and then Minister of Economics from
August 1934 until November 1937; and that he was appointed
Plenipotentiary General for War Economy in May 1935. He resigned
as Minister of Economics and Plenipotentiary General for War Economy
in November 1937, when he accepted appointment as Minister
without Portfolio, which post he held until January 1943. His position
as virtual economic dictator of Germany in the 4 crucial years
from early 1933 to the end of 1936 is practically a matter of
common knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht was the guiding genius behind the Nazi expansion of
the German credit system for rearmament purposes. From the
outset he recognized that the plan for the German military supremacy
required huge quantities of public credit. To that end a series
of measures was adopted which subverted all credit institutions in
Germany to the over-all aim of supplying funds for the military
machine. I will briefly mention some of these measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By Cabinet decree of 27 October 1933 the statutory reserve of
40 percent in gold and foreign exchange required against circulating
Reichsbank notes was permanently abandoned. By the Credit Act of
1934 the Government assumed jurisdiction of all credit institutions,
and control over the entire banking system was centralized in
Schacht as Chairman of the Supervisory Board for the Credit
System and President of the Reichsbank. This act not only enabled
Schacht to control the quantity of credit but also its use. On
29 March 1934 a system of forced corporate lending to the Reich
was imposed on German business. And on 19 February 1935 the
Treasury was authorized to borrow funds in any amounts approved
by the Reich Chancellor, that is, by Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On these points I ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice of the
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> 1933, Part II, Page 827; <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> 1934,
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
Part I, Page 1203; <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> 1934, Part I, Page 295; and
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> 1935, Part I, Page 198.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are they found here in the document book?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: They’re not in the document book, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked only that judicial notice be taken of them as published
laws of Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These measures enabled Schacht to embark upon what he himself
has termed a “daring credit policy,” including the secret
financing of a vast amount of armaments through the so-called ‘mefo’
bill, a description of which appears in the transcript for 23 November
at Page 295 (Volume II, Page 232). I offer in evidence Document
Number EC-436, Exhibit Number USA-620, consisting of a
statement, dated 2 November 1945, by Emil Puhl, a director of the
Reichsbank during Schacht’s presidency, and quote the second
paragraph thereof as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the early part of 1935 the need for financing an accelerated
rearmament program arose. Dr. Schacht, President of the
Reichsbank, after considering various techniques of financing,
proposed the use of mefo bills to provide a substantial portion
of the funds needed for the rearmament program. This
method had as one of its primary advantages the fact that
secrecy would be possible during the first years of the rearmament
program; and figures indicating the extent of
rearmament, that would have become public through the use
of other methods, could be kept secret through the use of
mefo bills.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The extent of the credit expansion and the importance of mefo
financing may be seen from Document Number EC-419, which I
now offer as Exhibit Number USA-621 and which consists of a
letter from Finance Minister Von Krosigk to Hitler, under date of
1 September 1938. I quote the following figures from the middle
of the first page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich debt accumulated as follows:</p>
<hr class='tbk228'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As of 31 December 1932: Funded debt, 10,400 millions of
Reichsmark; short-term debt, 2,100 millions of Reichsmark;
debt not published in the budget (trade and mefo bills of
exchange), 0.</p>
<hr class='tbk229'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As of 30 June 1938: Funded debt, 19,000 million Reichsmark;
short-term debt, 3,500 million Reichsmark; and debt not
published in the budget (trade and mefo bills of exchange),
13,300 million Reichsmark.</p>
<hr class='tbk230'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Total: as of 31 December 1932, 12,500 million Reichsmark; as
of 30 June 1938, 35,800 million Reichsmark.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Reich debt thus tripled.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would you read the next section, beginning
with the words “Provisions were made to cover.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: “Provisions were made to cover the armament
expenditures for the year 1938 (the same amount as in 1937) as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Five thousand millions from the budget, that is, taxes;
4,000 millions from loans; 2,000 millions from 6-month
treasury notes, which means postponement of payment until
1939; total: 11,000 millions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Reich debt thus tripled under Schacht’s management. More
than one-third of the total was financed secretly and through the
instrumentality of the Reichsbank by mefo and trade bills. It is clear
that this amount of financing outside the normal public issues
represented armament debt. I read further from Document EC-436,
at the beginning of the last long paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“These mefo bills were used exclusively for financing
rearmament; and when in March 1938 a new finance program
discontinuing the use of mefo bills was announced by
Dr. Schacht, there was a total volume outstanding of 12,000
million marks of mefo bills which had been issued to finance
rearmament.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The character of Schacht’s credit policy and the fact that it was
ruthlessly dedicated to the creation of armaments plainly appear
from his own speech delivered on 29 November 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I offer it in evidence as Document Number EC-611, Exhibit
Number USA-622; and I quote from Page 6 at the beginning of the
last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is possible that no bank of issue in peacetime carried on
such a daring credit policy as the Reichsbank since the seizure
of power by National Socialism. With the aid of this credit
policy, however, Germany created an armament second to
none; and this armament in turn made possible the results of
our policy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the field of finance Schacht assumed totalitarian control
over the German economy generally in order to marshal it behind
the rearmament program.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He acquired great power over industry as a result of the Nazi
reorganization of German industry along military lines and in
accordance with the so-called Leadership Principle. On this point
I refer the Tribunal to the transcript for 23 November at Pages
287-290 (Volume II, Pages 227-228); and to the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>
1934, Part I, Page 1194, of which the Tribunal is asked to take
judicial notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht also exercised broad powers as a member of the Reich
Defense Council, which was secretly established on 4 April 1933 and
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
the function of which was preparation for war. The Tribunal is
referred to the transcript for 23 November, Page 290 (Volume II,
Pages 228-229). I also offer in evidence as Document Number
EC-128, Exhibit Number USA-623, a report under date of 30 September
1934, showing the functions of the Ministry of Economics
in this respect. The report reveals concentration upon all the
familiar wartime economic problems, including stockpiling, production
of scarce goods, removal of industry to secure areas, fuel and
power supply for war production, machine tools, control of wartime
priorities, rationing, price control, civilian supply, and so on. I
wish to read into the Record merely an excerpt showing the jurisdiction
of the Ministry of Economics, beginning near the top of
Page 2 of Document Number EC-128:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“With the establishment of the Reich Defense Council and its
permanent committee the Reich Ministry of Economics has
been given the task of making economic preparation for war.
There should really be no need to explain the tremendous
importance of this task. Everyone remembers vividly how
terribly the lack of any economic preparation for war hit us
during the World War.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, in 1934, Schacht acquired sweeping powers under legislation
which authorized him, as Minister of Economics, to take any
measure deemed necessary for the development of the German
economy. In this connection reference is made to the Reichsgesetzblatt,
1934, Part I, Page 565, of which the Tribunal is asked to take
judicial notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The so-called “New Plan” devised by Schacht was announced in
the fall of 1934 shortly after he became Minister of Economics. In
this connection the Tribunal is referred to the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
1934, Part I, Page 816 and the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1935, Part I, Page
105, with the request that judicial notice be taken thereof. The New
Plan was Schacht’s basic program for obtaining the necessary
foreign-produced raw materials and foreign exchange required to
sustain the rearmament program.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With respect to the details of the New Plan, I offer in evidence
Document Number EC-437, Exhibit Number USA-624, consisting of
an affidavit of Emil Puhl, dated 7 November 1945. The entire text
is pertinent. Therefore, permission is requested to submit the
affidavit without reading therefrom, on condition that French and
Russian translations be prepared and filed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And German ones supplied, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: We will supply copies. I wish to say that the
original is in English, but the affidavit has already been translated
into German.
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: This affidavit by a co-worker of Schacht describes
in detail the many ingenious and often ruthless devices he used,
including negotiating “stand-still” agreements, forcing payment in
Reichsmark of interest and amortization on debts incurred in
foreign currency, using scrip and funding bonds for the same purpose,
suspending service on foreign-held debts, blocking foreign-held
marks, freezing foreign claims in Germany, eliminating unessential
foreign expenditures, requisitioning German-held foreign exchange,
subsidizing exports, issuing restricted marks, bartering under
clearing agreements, licensing imports, and controlling all foreign
exchange transactions to the end of favoring raw materials for
armaments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal is also asked to take judicial notice of <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
1934, Page 997; <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1933, Part I, Page 349; and
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1937, Part I, Page 600, relating to the clearing
bank, the conversion bank, and the maturity of foreign loans, all
of which decrees are mentioned in the affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht even went so far as to invest foreign-held Reichsmark
on deposit in German banks in rearmament notes, thus, as he put it,
financing rearmament with the assets of his political opponents.
Without reading therefrom, I refer your Honors to Document Number
1168-PS, Exhibit USA-37, being a memorandum from Schacht to
Hitler, dated 3 May 1935, which already appears in the transcript
on Pages 412 and 413 (Volume II, Pages 312, 313). Moreover,
Schacht even resorted to capital punishment to prevent the loss of
foreign exchange when frightened capital began to flee from the
country. In this connection reference is made to the Law against
Economic Sabotage, found in 1936 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I,
Page 999, of which the Tribunal is asked to take judicial notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht took particular pride in the results which were accomplished
under the stringent controls which he instituted under his
New Plan. I refer the Tribunal to Document Number EC-611, in
evidence as Exhibit Number USA-622, consisting of Schacht’s speech
in Berlin on 29 November 1938. I wish to read into the Record an
excerpt from the top of Page 10:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“If there is anything remarkable about the New Plan, it is
again only the fact that German organization under National
Socialist leadership succeeded in conjuring up in a very short
time the whole apparatus of supervision of imports, direction
of exports, and promotion of exports. The success of the New
Plan can be proved by means of a few figures. Calculated
according to quantity, the import of finished products was cut
down by 63 percent between 1934 and 1937. On the other
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
hand, the import of ores was increased by 132 percent, of
petroleum by 116, of grain by 102, and of rubber by 71
percent.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>While President of the Reichsbank and Minister of Economics,
Schacht acquired still another key position, that of Plenipotentiary
General for War Economy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He received this appointment from Hitler pursuant to the
unpublished Reich Defense Law secretly enacted on 21 May 1935.
This law is in evidence as Document Number 2261-PS, Exhibit
Number USA-24, consisting of a letter from Von Blomberg dated
24 June 1935 to the chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Forces,
together with copies of the Reich Defense Law and the Cabinet’s
memorandum relating thereto. Pertinent comments on and excerpts
from this document appear in the transcript for 23 November, at
Pages 278 and 292 (Volume II, Pages 220-229). I will simply state
therefore that by virtue of this appointment Schacht was put in
complete charge of economic planning and preparation for war in
peacetime, except for certain direct armament production under
control of the War Ministry. Upon the outbreak of war he was to
be the economic czar of Germany with complete control over the
activities of a number of key Reich ministries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht appointed Wohlthat as his deputy and organized a staff
to carry out his directives. In this connection I offer in evidence
excerpts from a pre-trial interrogation of Schacht under date
17 October 1945. This document is Exhibit Number USA-616
(Document 3729-PS). I wish to read into the Record a question
and answer found at the bottom of Page 40 of the document book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Let me ask you a general question then: Do you take
the responsibility as Plenipotentiary General for War Economy
for the writings that were made and the actions that were
done by Wohlthat and his assistants?’</p>
<hr class='tbk231'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘I have to.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I also offer in evidence Document Number EC-258, Exhibit
Number USA-625, consisting of a status report issued in December
1937 under the signature of Schacht’s deputy, Wohlthat. The report
is entitled, “The Preparation of the Economic Mobilization by
the Plenipotentiary General for War Economy.” Schacht had
withdrawn from office immediately prior to the preparation of
this report, and it plainly is a recapitulation of his accomplishments
while in office. Since the entire text is relevant, we ask permission
to submit the document without reading therefrom on condition
that translations into French and Russian be later filed with the
Tribunal.
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I do not think this is consistent with the
rule laid down by the Tribunal, which was that the translations
in the French and Russian languages should be submitted at the
same time. You are now suggesting that you can submit translations
at a later stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: Well, if Your Honor pleases, in any event I did
not plan to read from the document at this time and Defense
Counsel do have the German original.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I was not speaking of the Defense Counsel
so much as of the members of the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: We have the Russian translation in process now
and it was delayed and we were unable to get it here at this
time, but the delay will be very short and the document is of
critical importance to our case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: How long will it be before it is ready?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: I wouldn’t like to say precisely, Sir, but perhaps
within 4 or 5 days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What do you propose to do now, because
it is a very complicated and long document, is it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: It is and it shows.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Were you proposing to summarize it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: I was proposing to summarize it, Sir, now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal thinks that if you would
summarize it now and only be permitted to put it in at the stage
when you have the translation ready, you may summarize it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: I will summarize it now, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will it take long to summarize?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: Not very long, Sir; no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You see, it is 5 o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: I think there will be time to summarize it, and
then we will stop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document discloses that before his resignation Schacht had
worked out in amazing detail his plans and preparations for the
management of the economy in the forthcoming war. For example,
180,000 industrial plants in 300 industries had been surveyed with
respect to usefulness for war purposes; economic plans for the
production of 200 basic materials had been worked out; a system
for the letting of war contracts had been devised; allocations of
coal, motor fuel, and power had been determined; 248 million
Reichsmark had been spent on storage facilities alone; evacuation
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>
plans for war materials and skilled workers from military zones
had been worked out; 80 million wartime ration cards had already
been printed and distributed to local areas; and a card index
on the skills of some 22 million workers had been prepared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That concludes the summary, Your Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 11 January 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span><h1>THIRTY-SECOND DAY<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>Friday, 11 January 1946</span></h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: If the Tribunal please, before picking up our line
of proof against the Defendant Schacht, I would like to supply a
point of information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yesterday the President of the Tribunal inquired with respect
to Document Number EC-457, Exhibit Number USA-619. The question
raised by the Tribunal was with respect to the words “in
retirement” in the letterhead used by Schacht in writing to Hitler
in 1932. This is the letter in which Schacht expressed his belief in
the truth of the Nazi movement and in which he said that Hitler
could always count upon him as a reliable assistant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letterhead has printed upon it “The President of the Reichsbank”
and after that phrase there is typed the letters “a. D.”, and
I understand that those letters are an abbreviation for a German
phrase meaning “in retirement” and that it is customary, or it was
customary, in Germany for retired officials to continue to use their
titles with the letters “a. D.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: Yesterday we had just about completed our proof
with respect to the contribution of the Defendant Schacht to the
preparation for war, and I wish to submit one more document on
this point. This is Document Number EC-451, Exhibit Number
USA-626. It consists of a statement by George S. Messersmith,
United States Consul General in Berlin, 1930 to 1934. I will quote
therefrom, beginning with the second sentence of the fourth
paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It was his”—Schacht’s—“financial ability that enabled the
Nazi regime in the early days to find the financial basis for
the tremendous armament program and which made it possible
to carry it through. If it had not been for his efforts,
and this is not a personal observation of mine only but I
believe was shared and is shared by every observer at the
time, the Nazi regime would have been unable to maintain
itself in power and to establish its control over Germany,
much less to create the enormous war machine which was
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
necessary for its objectives in Europe and later throughout
the world.</p>
<hr class='tbk232'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The increased industrial activity in Germany incident to
rearmament made great imports of raw materials necessary,
while at the same time exports were decreasing. Yet by
Schacht’s resourcefulness, his complete financial ruthlessness,
and his absolute cynicism, Schacht was able to maintain and
to establish the situation for the Nazis. Unquestionably,
without this complete lending of his capacities to the Nazi
Government and all of its ambitions, it would have been
impossible for Hitler and the Nazis to develop an armed force
sufficient to permit Germany to launch an aggressive war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We turn now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, Lieutenant Bryson, I am not sure that
that gives a full or quite fair interpretation of the document. Don’t
you think perhaps you ought to read the paragraph before?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: The preceding paragraph, Sir?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>LT. BRYSON: “Dr. Schacht always attempted to play both
sides of the fence. He told me, and I know he told both other
American representatives in Berlin and various British
representatives, that he disapproved of practically everything
that the Nazis were doing. I recall on several occasions
his saying, after the Nazi Party came into power, that if the
Nazis were not stopped, they were going to ruin Germany
and the rest of the world with it. I recall distinctly that he
emphasized to me that the Nazis were inevitably going to
plunge Europe into war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>If the Court please, I would like to read also from the last
paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In my opinion Schacht was in no sense a captive of the Nazis.
He was not compelled to devote his time and his capacities
to their interest. His situation was such that he would most
likely have been able either to work on much less restrained
scale or to abstain from activity entirely. He continued to
lend his services to the Nazi Government out of opportunism.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We turn now to the third part of our case against Schacht. The
evidence is clear that he willingly contributed his efforts to the
Nazi conspiracy, knowing full well its aggressive designs. The Tribunal
will recall our proof that Schacht was converted to the Nazi
philosophy in 1931 and helped Hitler come to power in 1933. We
will now prove, first, that Schacht personally favored aggression
and, second, that in any event he knew Hitler’s aggressive intentions.
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>There is ample evidence to justify the conclusion that Schacht
rearmed Germany in order to see fulfilled his strong belief in
aggressive expansion as an instrument of German national policy.
Schacht had long been a German nationalist and expansionist. He
spoke against the Treaty of Versailles at Stuttgart as early as 1927.
I offer in evidence Document EC-415, Exhibit Number USA-627,
consisting of a collection of excerpts from speeches by Schacht.
I quote from the top of Page 2: “The Versailles Dictate cannot be
an eternal document, because not only its economic but also its
spiritual and moral premises are wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is common knowledge that he strongly favored acquisition of
colonial territory by Germany. However, he also favored acquisition
of contiguous territory in Europe. On 16 April 1929 at
the Paris conference in connection with reparations, he said.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you going to read the passage that
follows that at a later stage?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: At a later stage, if you please, Sir, in connection
with another point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well; go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: On 16 April 1929, at the Paris conference in connection
with reparations, he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany can as a whole pay only if the Corridor and Upper
Silesia will be handed back to Germany from Polish possession
and if, besides, somewhere on the earth, colonial territory
will be made available to Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): What are you quoting from?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: I offer in evidence Exhibit Number USA-628
(Document 3726-PS), consisting of excerpts from a pre-trial interrogation
of Schacht on 24 August 1945. You will find it in the
document book at the back, labelled “Interrogation of 24 August”.
At the top of the first page of the interrogation this statement was
quoted to Schacht, and his reply contains an admission of having
made the statement. In his reply he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“That Germany could not pay at the time after I made the
statement has been proved, and that Germany will not be
able to pay after this war will be proved in the future.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I wish to point out that this is the very territory which was the
subject of the armed aggression in September 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1935 Schacht stated flatly that Germany would, if necessary,
acquire colonies by force. I offer in evidence Document EC-450,
designated as Exhibit Number USA-629. This document consists of
an affidavit of S. R. Fuller, Jr., together with a transcript of his
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
conversation with Schacht at the American Embassy in Berlin on
23 September 1935. I wish to read from Page 6 of the document
where there appears a statement by Schacht in the lower half of
the page.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is the date of the conversation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: The conversation occurred on 23 September 1935.
The page number of this document is at the bottom, and I quote
from Page 6:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Schacht: ‘Colonies are necessary to Germany. We shall get
them through negotiation, if possible; but if not, we shall
take them.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In July 1936, when the rearmament program was well under
way, Schacht again publicly spoke of the Versailles Treaty. This
time his language contained an explicit threat of war. I refer the
Tribunal again to Document EC-415, which I have previously
introduced in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-627, consisting of
a collection of speeches by Schacht. I wish to read from the paragraph
beginning in the middle of the first page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“But the memory of war weighs undiminished upon the
peoples’ mind. That is because, deeper than material wounds,
moral wounds are smarting, inflicted by the so-called peace
treaties. Material loss can be made up through labor, but the
moral wrong which has been inflicted upon the conquered
peoples in the peace dictates, leaves a burning scar on the
peoples’ conscience. The spirit of Versailles has perpetuated
the fury of war; and there will not be a true peace, progress,
or reconstruction until the world desists from this spirit. The
German people will not tire of pronouncing this warning.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Later in the same year Schacht publicly advocated the doctrine
of Lebensraum for the German people. I quote again from Document
EC-415, Exhibit Number USA-627, being an excerpt from
Schacht’s speech at Frankfurt on 9 December 1936, on the second
page, the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany has too little living space for her population. She
has made every effort, and certainly greater efforts than any
other nation, to extract from her own existing small space
whatever is necessary for the securing of her livelihood.
However, in spite of all these efforts, the space does not
suffice.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In January 1937 Schacht, in a conversation with Ambassador
Davies, at least by inference threatened a breach of the peace in
demanding a colonial cession. I offer in evidence Document L-111,
being Exhibit Number USA-630, and consisting of excerpts from a
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
report under date of 20 January 1937, by Ambassador Davies to
the Secretary of State. I wish to read therefrom, beginning with the
second sentence of the second paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“He”—meaning Schacht—“stated the following:</p>
<hr class='tbk233'/>
<p class='noindent'>“That the present condition of the German people was intolerable,
desperate, and unendurable; that he had been authorized
by his Government to submit proposals to France and
England which would: (1) Guarantee European peace, (2)
secure present European international boundaries, (3) reduce
armaments, (4) establish a new form of a workable league
of nations, and (5) abolish sanctions with new machinery for
joint administration; all based upon a colonial cession that
would provide for Germany an outlet for population, a source
for foodstuffs, fats, and raw materials.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In December 1937 Ambassador Dodd noted in his diary that
Schacht would be willing to risk war for the sake of new territory
in Europe. I refer the Tribunal to Document EC-461, consisting
of excerpts from Ambassador Dodd’s diary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The proposal contained in Document L-111
was for cession of colonies, was it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: It was, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turn now to Document EC-461, consisting of excerpts from
Ambassador Dodd’s diary. The entire diary has previously been
received in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-58. I quote some
notes on a conversation with Schacht on 21 December 1937,
beginning near the bottom of the second page of Document EC-461,
in the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Schacht meant what the army chiefs of 1914 meant when
they invaded Belgium, expecting to conquer France in
6 weeks; that is, domination and annexation of neighboring
little countries, especially north and east. Much as he dislikes
Hitler’s dictatorship, he, like most other eminent Germans,
wishes annexation without war if possible; with war if the
United States will keep hands off.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: There is another passage in that book, that
diary. I am not sure; it probably is not the same date, but it is
on the first page of the exhibit, I think—the third paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: The third paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is it at a different time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: It is a different time, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: September the 19th of what year?
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: We will check that in the complete volume here,
and I think in a minute I will be able to supply the date. In the
meantime would you like me to read it, Sir?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I think you had better read it.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>LT. BRYSON: “He then acknowledged that the Hitler Party
is absolutely committed to war; and the people, too, are
ready and willing. Only a few government officials are aware
of the dangers and are opposed. He concluded, ‘But we shall
postpone it 10 years. Then it may be we can avoid war.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think you should read the next
paragraph, too.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>LT. BRYSON: “I reminded him of his Bad Eilsen speech
some 2 weeks ago and said, ‘I agree with you about commercial
and financial matters in the main. But why do you
not, when you speak before the public, tell the German
people they must abandon a war attitude?’ He replied, ‘I
dare not say that. I can speak only on my special subjects.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And the next one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: And the next one:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“How, then, can German people ever learn the real dangers
of war, if nobody ever presents that side of the question?
He once more emphasized his opposition to war and added
that he had used his influence with Hitler—‘a very great
man’, he interjected—to prevent war. I said, ‘The German
papers printed what I said at Bremen about commercial
relations between our countries, but not a word about the
terrible effects and barbarism of war.’ He acknowledged that
and talked very disapprovingly of the Propaganda Ministry
which suppresses everything it dislikes. He added, as I was
leaving ‘You know a party comes into office by propaganda
and then cannot disavow it or stop it.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The date of his conversation was in September 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is a pity that those years are not stated
in the document. It is rather misleading as it is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: If the Court please, the exhibit which is in
evidence will show the dates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I am not blaming you; but it is
misleading, because it looks like September the 19th and December
the 21st, and as there were 3 years’ interval between, it makes a
difference. That is right, isn’t it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: Yes, that is right. I am sorry the excerpt simply
shows the page numbers from the exhibit, and not the dates.
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht admittedly strained all the resources of Germany to
build up a Wehrmacht which would provide Hitler with an
instrument of realization of his desire for Lebensraum. In this
connection I offer in evidence Document Number EC-369, Exhibit
Number USA-631, consisting of a memorandum from the Reichsbank
Directorate, signed by Schacht, to Hitler, dated 7 January
1939. I wish to read the last paragraph of the first page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“From the beginning the Reichsbank has been aware of the
fact that a successful foreign policy can be attained only by
the reconstruction of the German Armed Forces. It—the
Reichsbank—therefore assumed to a very great extent the
responsibility of financing the rearmament in spite of the
inherent dangers to the currency. The justification thereof
was the necessity, which pushed all other considerations into
the background, to carry through the armament at once, out
of nothing and furthermore under camouflage, which made
a respect-commanding foreign policy possible.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is clear that the “successful foreign policy” which Schacht
thus attributed to rearmament included the Austrian and Czechoslovakian
acquisitions. I offer in evidence Document EC-297(a),
Exhibit Number USA-632, being a speech of Schacht’s in Vienna
after the Anschluss in March 1938. I quote from the third page
and the second full paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Thank God, these things could not after all hinder the great
German people on their way, for Adolf Hitler has created a
communion of German will and German thought. He
bolstered it with the newly strengthened Wehrmacht and
finally gave the external form to the internal union between
Germany and Austria.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>With respect to the Sudetenland I refer the Tribunal to Document
EC-611, already in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-622, being
a speech by Schacht; EC-611—but I will not read it, Sir—being
a speech by Schacht on 29 November 1938, shortly after the
Munich settlement. I have earlier read the pertinent remark attributing
Hitler’s success at that conference to the rearmament made
possible by Schacht’s financial and economic measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This line of proof shows that Schacht entertained an aggressive
philosophy with respect to territorial expansion and justifies the
conclusion that he allied himself with Hitler because of their
common viewpoint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We turn now to prove that, whether or not Schacht wanted war,
he at least knew Hitler planned military aggression for which
he was creating the means. He had numerous discussions with
Hitler from 1933 to 1937. He knew that Hitler was intent upon
expansion to the east, which would mean war, and that Hitler felt
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
he must present the German people with a military victory. I offer
in evidence Exhibit Number USA-633 (Document 3727-PS), consisting
of an excerpt from a pre-trial interrogation of Schacht on
13 October 1945, and I read from the second page at the end of
the second question:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘What was there in what he’ ”—meaning Hitler—“ ‘said
that led you to believe he was intending to move towards
the east?’</p>
<hr class='tbk234'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘That is in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>. He never spoke to me about
that, but it was in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>.’</p>
<hr class='tbk235'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘In other words, as a man who read it, you understood
that Hitler’s expansion policy was directed to the east?’</p>
<hr class='tbk236'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘To the east.’</p>
<hr class='tbk237'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘And you thought that it would be better to try to divert
Hitler from any such intention and to urge upon him a
colonial policy instead?’</p>
<hr class='tbk238'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘Quite.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I also offer in evidence Document EC-458, Exhibit Number
USA-634, consisting of an affidavit of Major Edmund Tilley under
date of 21 November 1945, with respect to an interview of Schacht
on 9 July 1945. I read the second paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the course of the discussion Schacht stated to me that
he had had numerous talks with Hitler from 1933 to 1937.
Schacht stated that from these talks he had formed the
impression that in order to make his hold and government
secure, the Führer felt that he must present the German
people with a military victory.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As early as 1934, Schacht stated his belief that the Nazis would
bring war to Europe. I refer the Tribunal to Document EC-451,
which I have already submitted in evidence as Exhibit Number
USA-626, consisting of an affidavit under date of 15 November
1945 by Messersmith, American Consul General in Berlin, 1930 to
1934. I wish to read from the first page, third paragraph, last
sentence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You have read it already.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: If the Court please, there is a little more there
which we have not read, which I should like to read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You read the whole paragraph. At our invitation
you read from the third paragraph down to the bottom of
the page.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: I should like to read the first sentence of the
fourth paragraph on Page 1.
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: All right.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>LT. BRYSON: “While making these protestations he nevertheless
showed by his acts that he was thoroughly an
instrument of the whole Nazi program and ambitions and
that he was lending all his extraordinary knowledge and
resourcefulness toward the accomplishment of that program.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Lieutenant Bryson, speaking for myself
and for some other members of the Tribunal, we think it is a far
better way to deal with a document, to deal with it, if possible,
once and for all, and not to be coming back to it. It not only
wastes time by the fact that the Tribunal have got to turn back
and forth, back and forth, to the document; but you get a much
fairer idea of the document if it is dealt with once and for all,
although it may cover more than one subject. I say that although
it may be impossible for you to do that now in consonance with
the preparations that you have made; but those who follow you
may be able to alter their course. If it is possible, when you get
a document with a variety or a number of paragraphs in it which
you want to quote, you should quote them all at the same time.
Do you follow what I mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: I follow you, Your Honor. We have so organized
our materials that we have directed our evidence to specific points,
and since the points are separated, we had to separate our
quotations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I realize that it may be difficult for you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: In September of 1934 Ambassador Dodd made
a record in his diary of a conversation with Sir Eric Phipps at the
British Embassy in Berlin. If the Court please, I will pass over
this document, because in response to a question from the Tribunal,
I read an excerpt from the document which covers the same point
that I was about to direct myself toward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had just pointed out that Schacht has acknowledged to
Ambassador Dodd in September 1934 his knowledge of the war
purposes of the Nazi Party; and we had already shown that in
1935 Schacht had stated that Germany would, if necessary, acquire
colonies by force. He must then have known to what length
Hitler was prepared to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After attending a meeting of the Reich ministers on 27 May
1936 in Berlin, Schacht must have known that Hitler was contemplating
war. Your Honors may recall, as has been earlier
shown, that at this meeting the Defendant Göring, who was very
close to Hitler, stated that all measures are to be considered from
the standpoint of an assured waging of war and that waiting for
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
new methods is no longer appropriate. I refer the Tribunal to
Document 1301-PS, from which I will not read, as the quotation
is already in evidence in Exhibit Number USA-123.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 31 August 1936 the War Minister, Von Blomberg, sent to
Schacht a copy of Von Blomberg’s letter to the Defendant Göring. I
refer the Tribunal again to 1301-PS, previously submitted in evidence
as Exhibit Number USA-123, and read from the middle of Page
19 of the document. The page numbers, if the Court please, on
this document are found in the upper lefthand corner:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“According to an order of the Führer the setting up of all
Air Force units is to be completed on 1 April 1937. Therefore
considerable expenditures have to be made in 1936,
which at the time when the budget for 1936 was made were
planned for later years only.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This intensification of the air force program certainly revealed
to Schacht the closeness to war which Hitler must have felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I also offer in evidence Document EC-416, Exhibit USA-635,
consisting of minutes of the Cabinet meeting of 4 September 1936
which Schacht attended. I read the statement by Göring found
at the top of Page 2 of this document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Führer and Reichskanzler has given a memorandum
to the Colonel General and the Reich War Minister which
represents a general instruction for the execution of this
task.</p>
<hr class='tbk239'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It starts from the basic thought that the show-down with
Russia is inevitable.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht thus knew that Hitler expected war with Russia. He
also knew of Hitler’s ambitions towards the east. It must have been
plain to him, therefore, that such a war would result from Russian
opposition to German military expansion in that direction; that
is, Schacht must have known that it would be a war of German
aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In January 1937, the Tribunal will recall, Schacht stated to
Ambassador Davies in Berlin that he had “been authorized by his
government” to submit certain proposals to France and England
which, in fact, amounted to a bid for colonies under threat of
war. If Schacht was acting under instructions from Hitler, he was
necessarily familiar with Hitler’s aggressive intentions at that
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In November of 1937 Schacht knew Hitler was determined to
acquire Austria and at least autonomy for the Germans of
Bohemia and that Hitler also had designs on the Polish Corridor.
I refer the Tribunal to Document L-151, already in evidence as
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
Exhibit Number USA-70, this being a letter containing a memorandum
of a conversation between Schacht and Ambassador Bullitt,
dated 23 November 1937. I quote the last paragraph on Page 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Hitler was determined to have Austria eventually attached
to Germany and to obtain at least autonomy for the Germans
of Bohemia. At the present moment he was not vitally
concerned about the Polish Corridor, and in his”—Schacht’s—“opinion
it might be possible to maintain the Corridor,
provided Danzig were permitted to join East Prussia and
provided some sort of a bridge could be built across the
Corridor uniting Danzig and East Prussia with Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To digress for just a moment, Schacht here was really speaking
for himself as well as for Hitler. We have seen from his speech
of 29 March 1938 in Vienna his enthusiasm for the Anschluss after
the event. He was even working hard for its achievement. In
this connection I refer the Tribunal to Pages 506 and 507 of the
transcript (Volume II, Page 373) for evidence of Schacht’s having
subsidized the Nazis’ preliminary agitation in Austria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to the foregoing direct evidence, the Tribunal is
asked to take into consideration the fact that to such a man as
Schacht the events of the period certainly bespoke Hitler’s
intention. Schacht was a close collaborator of Hitler and a member
of the Cabinet during the period of the Nazi agitation in Austria,
the introduction of conscription, the march into the Rhineland, the
overthrow of the Republican Government in Spain, the ultimate
conquest of Austria, and the acquisition of the Sudetenland by a
show of force. During this period the Reich’s debt tripled under
the stress of mounting armaments, the expenditures from
750,000,000 Reichsmarks in 1932 to 11,000,000,000 Reichsmarks in
1937, and 14,000,000,000 Reichsmarks in 1938. During the entire
period 35,000,000,000 Reichsmarks were spent on armaments. It
was a period in which the burning European foreign policy issue
was the satisfaction of Germany’s repeated demands for additional
territory. Hitler, committed to a policy of expansion, was taking
great risks in foreign policy and laying the greatest stress upon
utmost speed in preparation for war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly, in this setting Schacht did not proceed in ignorance
of the fact that he was assisting Hitler and Germany along the
road toward armed aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We turn now to our last line of proof with respect to Schacht’s
loss of power in the Hitler regime. In November 1937, Schacht
resigned his offices as Minister of Economics and General Plenipotentiary
for the War Economy. At that time he accepted
appointment as Minister without Portfolio and he also continued
as President of the Reichsbank.
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Our evidence will show: (a) This change in position was no
more than a clash between two power-seeking personalities,
Göring and Schacht, in which Göring, being closer to Hitler, won
out; (b) their policy differences were concerned only with the
method of rearming; and (c) Schacht’s loss of power in no sense
implies an unwillingness to assist armed aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an issue of policy between Göring and Schacht, but
it was concerned only with the method and not the desirability
of war preparations. Schacht emphasized foreign trade as a
necessary source of rearmament material during the transitory
period until Germany should be ready to strike. Göring was a
proponent of complete self-sufficiency. Hitler supported Göring;
and Schacht, his pride wounded and bitterly resenting Göring’s
intrusion in the economic field, finally stepped out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I refer the Tribunal to Document 1301-PS, previously submitted
in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-123, containing notes of a
conversation between Schacht and Thomas on 2 September 1936.
These are found on Page 21 of the document, from which I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“President Schacht called me to him at 1300 hours today and
requested me to forward the following to the Minister of
War: Schacht returned from the Führer with the greatest
anxiety, since he could not agree to the economic program
planned by the Führer.</p>
<hr class='tbk240'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Führer wants to speak at the Party convention about
economic policy and wants to emphasize there that we now
want to get free from foreign countries with all our energy
by production in Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk241'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Schacht requests urgently that the Reich Minister of War
warn the Führer from this step.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And three paragraphs farther down:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“If we now shout out abroad our decision to make ourselves
economically independent, then we cut our own throats,
because we can no longer survive the necessary transitory
period.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, Hitler announced the Four Year Plan of self-sufficiency
a few days later in Nuremberg, and against Schacht’s wishes
Göring was named Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point I refer the Tribunal again to the interrogation of
Schacht on 16 October 1945, being Exhibit Number USA-636; and
I wish to read beginning near the bottom of Page 9 of the document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘And the Four Year Plan came in when?’</p>
<hr class='tbk242'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘It was announced in September ’36, on the Party Day.’
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk243'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Do you say that from the time that the Four Year Plan
came in in September 1936, you were ready to rid yourself of
your economic duty?’</p>
<hr class='tbk244'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘No. At that time I thought that I might maintain my
position even against Göring.’</p>
<hr class='tbk245'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Yes, in what sense?’</p>
<hr class='tbk246'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘That he would not interfere with affairs which I had to
manage in my ministry.’</p>
<hr class='tbk247'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘As a matter of fact, his appointment was not met with
favor by you?’</p>
<hr class='tbk248'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘I would not have ever appointed a man like Göring
who didn’t understand a bit about all these things.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht and Göring immediately became embroiled in a conflict
of jurisdiction. On 26 November 1936 Göring issued a directive
regarding raw and synthetic material production. I offer in evidence
Document EC-243, Exhibit Number USA-637, consisting of a copy
of this directive. It shows that Göring’s Office for Raw and Synthetic
Materials pre-empted control over large economic areas
previously in the hands of Schacht. As an example, I will quote
from Paragraph V of the directive on Page 4 of the document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The planning and determination of objectives, as well as
the control over the execution of the tasks which must be
accomplished within the framework of the Four Year Plan,
are the responsibility of the Office for German Raw and
Synthetic Materials, which supersedes the authorities which
have heretofore been in charge of these tasks.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 11 December 1936 Schacht found it necessary to order all
supervisory offices in the Ministry of Economics to accept instructions
from him alone. I offer in evidence Document EC-376, Exhibit
Number USA-638, consisting of a circular letter from Schacht to
all supervisory offices under date of 11 December 1936, and I quote
from the second paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The supervisory offices are obliged to accept instructions
from me alone. They must answer all official inquiries for
any information of the Office for German Raw and Synthetic
Materials in order to give any information at any time to
the fullest extent.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And a little further down:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I herewith authorize the supervisory offices to take the
necessary measures for themselves. In case doubts should
result from requests of the above offices and these doubts
cannot be cleared by oral negotiations with the experts of
these offices, I should be informed immediately. I will then
order in each case the necessary steps to be taken.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The military sided with Schacht, who had rearmed them so
well. I offer in evidence Document EC-420, Exhibit Number USA-639,
consisting of a draft of a memorandum by the Military Economic
Staff, dated 19 December 1936. I wish to read from Paragraph 1:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“(1) The direction of war economy in the civilian sector in
case of war can be handled only by the person who in
peacetime has borne the sole responsibility for the preparations
for war.</p>
<hr class='tbk249'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Upon recognizing this fact a year and a half ago Reichsbank
President Dr. Schacht was appointed Plenipotentiary
General for War Economy and an operations staff was attached
to his office.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then Paragraph Number 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“(2) The Military Economy Staff does not deem it compatible
with the principle laid down in Number 1, Paragraph 1, if
the Plenipotentiary General for War Economy is now placed
under the Minister President General Göring’s command.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In January 1937 the <span class='it'>Military Weekly Gazette</span> published an
article warmly praising Schacht’s achievements in rearmament.
Without reading it I offer in evidence Document EC-383, Exhibit
Number USA-640, containing this article, a pertinent quotation from
which already appears in the transcript for 23 November at Page 296
(Volume II, Page 233).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly thereafter Schacht attempted to force a show-down with
Göring by temporarily refusing to act in his capacity as Plenipotentiary.
I offer in evidence Document EC-244, Exhibit Number
641, consisting of a letter from Von Blomberg, the Minister of
War, to Hitler under date of February 22, 1937. I read the second
paragraph of this letter as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The President of the Reichsbank, Dr. Schacht, has notified
me that he is not acting in his capacity as Plenipotentiary
for the time being, since in his opinion there exist discrepancies
regarding the powers conferred upon him and those of
Colonel General Göring. Because of this the preparatory
mobilization steps in the economic field are delayed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht obviously was using his importance to the war preparations
as a lever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Lieutenant Bryson, does the Defendant
Schacht admit in his interrogation that the reason for his giving up
his office was the difference of opinion between him and the
Defendant Göring?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: He does, Sir, and the Defendant Göring so
states in his interrogation.
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is it necessary to go into the details of their
quarrel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: If the Court will be satisfied that this was the
cause of Schacht’s resignation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If they both say so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that the cause was not his unwillingness
to go along with the aggressive intentions of the Nazis at that time,
I shall be perfectly satisfied to confine our evidence to the interrogations
of Schacht and Göring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does he suggest that in his interrogation?—that
that might have been the reason?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: I will find out, Sir, but our case against Schacht
is premised upon conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If the Defendant Schacht wants to set up
such a case as that, you could apply to be heard in rebuttal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: Well, we shall be satisfied then to eliminate a
number of our items of evidence, including the controversy between
Göring and Schacht, and satisfy ourselves with the interrogations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: If the Court please, we are almost at the time
of the break. Perhaps during the break we can arrange our evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we will adjourn now for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>PROFESSOR DR. HERBERT KRAUS (Counsel for Defendant
Schacht): We agree that the question of the disagreement between
the Defendants Göring and Schacht need not be discussed further
at this time. But we shall come back to and deal in detail with the
question as to how far these disagreements had any bearing on the
plan for an aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: If the Tribunal please, we have eliminated part
of our proof. I would simply like to put in a letter from Göring and
an interrogation of Schacht which will finish up the question of the
disagreement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under date of 5 August 1937 Schacht wrote a critical letter to
Göring, who replied with a 24-page letter on 22 August 1937.
Göring’s letter reviews their many differences in detail. I offer it
as Document EC-493, Exhibit Number USA-642, and I wish to read
simply one statement found in the middle of Page 13:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In conclusion I should like to refer to remarks which you
made in a paragraph of your letter entitled ‘The Four
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
Year Plan’ about your general attitude toward my work in
regard to the economic policy. I know and I am pleased
that at the beginning of the Four Year Plan you promised
me your most loyal support and co-operation and that you
repeatedly renewed this promise even after the first differences
of opinion had occurred and had been removed in
exhaustive discussions. I deplore all the more having the
impression recently, which is confirmed by your letter, that
you are increasingly antagonistic toward my work in the
Four Year Plan. This explains the fact that our collaboration
has gradually become less close.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht and Göring were reconciled by written agreement on
7 July 1937 but subsequently again fell into disagreement, and
Hitler finally accepted Schacht’s resignation as Minister of Economics
on 26 November 1937, simultaneously appointing him
Minister without Portfolio, and later Schacht’s resignation was
extended to his position as Plenipotentiary for War Economy.
Without reading it, I offer in evidence Document EC-494, Exhibit
Number USA-643, as proof of this fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, finally, I wish to refer the Tribunal to the interrogation
of Schacht, under date of 16 October 1945, Document 3728-PS,
Exhibit Number USA-636, and I wish to read from Page 12 of the
document near the bottom:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘It may amuse you if I tell you that the last conversation’ ”—this
is Schacht speaking—“ ‘that I had with Göring
on these topics was in November 1937, when Luther for 2
months had endeavored to unite Göring and myself and
to induce me to co-operate further with Göring and maintain
my position as Minister of Economics. Then I had a last talk
with Göring; and at the end of this talk Göring said, “But
I must have the right to give orders to you.” Then I said,
“Not to me, but to my successor.” I have never taken orders
from Göring; and I would never have done it because he
was a fool in economics, and I knew something about it,
at least.’</p>
<hr class='tbk250'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Well, I gather that was a culminating, progressive
personal business between you and Göring. That seems
perfectly obvious.’</p>
<hr class='tbk251'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘Certainly.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In all this abundant and consistent evidence there is not the
slightest suggestion that Schacht’s withdrawal from these two posts
represented a break with Hitler on the ground of contemplated
military aggression. Indeed, Hitler was gratified that Schacht would
still be active in the Government as President of the Reichsbank
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
and as Minister without Portfolio. I offer in evidence Document
L-104, Exhibit Number USA-644, consisting of a letter to the
United States Secretary of State from Ambassador Dodd, under
date of 29 November 1937, enclosing a translation of Hitler’s letter
of 26 November 1937 to Schacht. I quote the last two sentences of
Hitler’s letter, found on Page 2 of the document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“If I accede to your wish it is with the expression of deepest
gratitude for your so excellent achievements and in the happy
consciousness that, as President of the Reichsbank Directorate
you will make available for the German people and me
for many years more your outstanding knowledge and ability
and your untiring energy. Delighted at the fact that in the
future, also, you are willing to be my personal adviser, I
appoint you as of today a Reich Minister.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht did continue, obviously still in full agreement with
Hitler’s aggressive purpose. He was still President of the Reichsbank
at the time of the taking of Austria in March 1938. In fact,
the Reichsbank took over the Austrian National Bank. On this
point I refer the Tribunal to <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> 1938, Part I, Page
254, and ask that judicial notice be taken thereof. Further, Schacht
even participated in the planning of the absorption of Austria. In
this connection I introduce into evidence Document EC-421, Exhibit
Number USA-645, consisting of excerpts from minutes of a meeting
of the staff of General Thomas on 11 March 1938 at 1500 hours.
I quote therefrom as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Lieutenant Colonel Hünerm reads directive of the Führer
of 11 March concerning the ‘Action Otto’ and informs us
that ‘The Economy War Service Law’ has been put in force.
He then reads Directives 1 and 2 and gives special orders to
troops for crossing the Austrian borders. According to that,
at Schacht’s suggestion, no requisitions should be made but
everything ought to be paid for at the rate of 2 schillings
to 1 Reichsmark.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the conversion of the Austrian schilling the Tribunal is
asked also to take judicial notice of <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> 1938, Part I,
Page 405.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal, of course, is already familiar with the public
approval by Schacht of the Anschluss in his Vienna speech of
21 March 1938, and Your Honors will also recall Schacht’s pride
in Hitler’s use of the rearmed Wehrmacht at Munich, as expressed
in his speech of 29 November 1938. Both speeches were subsequent
to his resignation in November 1937.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We come now to the removal of Schacht from the presidency
of the Reichsbank in January 1939. The reason for this development
is quite clear. Schacht lost confidence in the credit capacity
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
of the Reich and was paralyzed, with the fear of a financial collapse.
He felt that the maximum level of production had been
reached, so that an increase in banknote circulation would only
cheapen money and bring on inflation. In this attitude he ceased
to be useful to Hitler, who was about to strike and wished to tap
every ounce of available Government credit for military purposes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I refer the Tribunal to Document EC-369, which I have previously
submitted in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-631. This document
is a memorandum from the Reichsbank directorate to Hitler,
under date of 7 January 1939, in which Schacht reviews in detail
his fears of inflation. The seriousness of the situation may be
seen generally from the entire text. I wish to quote several of
the more crucial statements, one from the last paragraph on
Page 3, the second sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We are, however, faced with the fact that approximately
3 billion Reichsmark of such drafts cannot now be paid,
though they will be due in 1939.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I quote from the upper half of Page 4:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Exclusive of the Reichsbank there are approximately 6
billion Reichsmark mefo drafts which can be discounted
against cash payment at any time at the Reichsbank, which
fact represents a continuous danger to the currency.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And I quote finally from the concluding paragraph of the
memorandum:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We are convinced that the effects on the currency caused
by the policy of the last 10 months can be mended and that
the danger of inflation again can be eliminated by strict
maintenance of a balanced budget. The Führer and Reich
Chancellor himself has publicly rejected, again and again, an
inflation as foolish and fruitless.</p>
<hr class='tbk252'/>
<p class='noindent'>“We therefore ask for the following measures:</p>
<hr class='tbk253'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(1) The Reich as well as all the other public offices must
not incur expenditures or assume guaranties and obligations
that cannot be covered by taxes or by those funds which
can be raised through loans without disturbing the long-term
investment market.</p>
<hr class='tbk254'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(2) In order to carry out these measures effectively, full
financial control over all public expenditures must be restored
to the Reich Minister of Finance.</p>
<hr class='tbk255'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(3) The price and wage control must be rendered effective.
The existing mismanagement must be eliminated.</p>
<hr class='tbk256'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(4) The use of the money and investment market must be
at the sole discretion of the Reichsbank.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It is clear that Schacht’s fear was genuine and is a complete
explanation for his departure from the scene. He had good reason
to be afraid. In fact, the Finance Minister had already recognized
the situation in September 1938. I refer the Tribunal to Document
EC-419, Exhibit Number USA-621, which I have already
submitted in evidence and which consists of a letter under date
of 1 September 1938 from Krosigk to Hitler, in which Krosigk
warns of an impending financial crisis. I quote from the bottom
of Page 2.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is that not really cumulative of what you
have already read?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: We will be glad to skip it, Sir. It is cumulative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht was not only afraid of a financial crisis, but he was
afraid that he personally would be held responsible for it. I offer
in evidence an affidavit of Emil Puhl, a director of the Reichsbank
and co-worker of Schacht, dated 8 November 1945, designated as
Document EC-438, Exhibit Number USA-646, and I read therefrom,
beginning at the bottom of the second page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“When Schacht saw that the risky situation which he had
sponsored was becoming insoluble, he was more and more
eager to get out. This desire to get out of a bad situation
was for a long time the ‘Leitmotiv’ of Schacht’s conversation
with the directors of the bank.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the end Schacht escaped by deliberately stimulating his dismissal
from the Presidency of the Reichsbank. I offer in evidence
Document 3731-PS, Exhibit Number USA-647, consisting of excerpts
from an interrogation of Von Krosigk under date of 24 September
1945, and I wish to read several statements beginning at the very
bottom of the second page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I asked Mr. Schacht to finance for the Reich for the ultimo
of the month the sum of 100 or 200 millions. It was this
quite customary procedure which we had used for years, and
we used to give back this money after a couple of days.
Schacht this time refused and said that he was not willing to
finance a penny because he wanted, as he said, that it should
be made clear to Hitler that the Reich was bankrupt. I tried
to explain that this was not the proper ground to discuss the
whole question of financing because the question of financing
very small sums for a few days during ultimo never would
bring Hitler to the conviction that the whole financing was
impossible. As far as I remember now, it was Funk who
told Hitler something about this conversation; then Hitler
asked Schacht to call upon him. I do not know what they
said but the result certainly was the dismissal of Schacht.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Just give me the reference again to that
document that you were reading from.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. BRYSON: This is the interrogation of Von Krosigk under
date of 24 September 1945. I wish to read further, continuing on
Page 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Now did Schacht ever say anything to you to the effect
that he wanted to resign because he was in opposition to the
continuance of the rearmament program?’</p>
<hr class='tbk257'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘No, he never said it in this specific form, but in some
conversations he certainly spoke about it several times in his
own way when he had encounters with Göring .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. therefore
I did not take these things very seriously.’</p>
<hr class='tbk258'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Well, let me put it this way, and please think carefully
about this. Did Schacht ever say that he wanted to resign
because he realized that the extent of the rearmament program
was such as to lead him to the conclusion that it was in
preparation for war rather than for defense?’</p>
<hr class='tbk259'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘No, he never did.’</p>
<hr class='tbk260'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Was Schacht ever quoted to you to this effect by any
of your colleagues or by anybody else?’</p>
<hr class='tbk261'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘No.’</p>
<hr class='tbk262'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Now, after Keitel took over the position of Chief of
the Wehrmacht were there still meetings between Schacht
and yourself with Keitel in place of Blomberg?’</p>
<hr class='tbk263'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘Yes.’</p>
<hr class='tbk264'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Did Schacht ever say anything at these meetings to indicate
that except for the technical question of the financing
through the Reichsbank directly he was opposed to a further
program of rearmament or opposed to the budget of the
Wehrmacht?’</p>
<hr class='tbk265'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘No, I do not think he ever did.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Göring has also confirmed this testimony. I
refer the Tribunal to the interrogation of Göring under date of
17 October 1945, this being Document 3730-PS, Exhibit Number
USA-648. I read from the interrogation of Göring on 17 October
1945, from the lower half of the third page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘I want to ask you this specifically. Was Schacht dismissed
from the Reichsbank by Hitler for refusing to participate
any further in the rearmament program?'</p>
<hr class='tbk266'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘No, because of his utterly impossible attitude in this
matter regarding this advance, which had no connection with
the rearmament program.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler dismissed Schacht from the Reichsbank on 20 January
1939. Without reading, I offer in evidence Document EC-398, Exhibit
Number USA-649, consisting merely of a brief note from
Hitler to Schacht announcing his dismissal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From all of the foregoing it is clear that Schacht’s dismissal in
no sense reflected a parting of the ways with Hitler on account of
proposed aggression. This fact may also be seen from Document
EC-397, Exhibit Number USA-650, consisting of Hitler’s letter to
Schacht under date of 19 January 1939, the text of which I wish to
read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At the occasion of your recall from office as President of
the Reichsbank Directorate I take the opportunity of expressing
to you my most sincere and warmest gratitude for the
services which you have rendered repeatedly to Germany
and to me personally in this capacity during long and difficult
years. Your name, above all, will always be connected with
the first epoch of the national rearmament. I am happy to
be able to avail myself of your services for the solution of
new tasks in your position as Reich Minister.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In fact, Schacht continued as Minister without Portfolio until
January 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish to conclude by saying that the evidence shows: First,
Schacht’s work was indispensable to Hitler’s rise to power and
to the rearmament of Germany; second, Schacht personally was
favorably disposed towards aggression and knew Hitler intended to
and would break the peace; and, third, Schacht retired from the
scene for reasons wholly unrelated to the imminence of illegal
aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As long as he remained in power, Schacht was working as
eagerly for the preparation of aggressive war as any of his
colleagues. He was beyond any doubt most effective and valuable
in this connection. His assistance in the earlier phase of the conspiracy
made their later crimes possible. His withdrawal from the
scene reflected no moral feeling against the use of aggressive
warfare as an instrument of national policy. He personally
struggled to retain his position. By the time he lost it he had
already completed his task in the conspiracy, namely, to provide
Hitler and his colleagues with the physical means and economic
planning necessary to launch and maintain the aggression. We do
not believe that, having prepared the Wehrmacht for assault upon
the world, he should now be permitted to find refuge in his loss
of power before the blow was struck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This concludes our case against the Defendant Schacht, and
Lieutenant Meltzer follows me with the presentation of the American
case against the Defendant Funk.
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>LIEUTENANT (j. g.) BERNHARD D. MELTZER (Assistant
Trial Counsel for the United States): May it please the Tribunal,
the documents bearing upon Defendant Funk’s responsibility have
been assembled in a document book marked “HH,” which has been
filed with the Tribunal and has also been made available to Defense
Counsel. The same is true of the brief. The documents have been
arranged in the book in the order of their presentation. Moreover,
to facilitate reference, the pages of the document book have been
numbered consecutively in red. I wish to acknowledge the
invaluable collaboration of Mr. Sidney Jacoby, who sits to my right,
in the selection and analysis of these documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We propose to submit evidence concerning five phases of Defendant
Funk’s participation in the conspiracy:</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, his contribution to the Nazi seizure of power; second, his
role in the Propaganda Ministry and in the related agencies and
his responsibility for the activities of that ministry; third, his responsibility
for the unrelenting elimination of Jews, first from the
so-called cultural professions and then from the entire German
economy; fourth, his collaboration in the paramount Nazi task to
which all other tasks were subordinated—preparation for aggressive
war; and finally, we propose to mention briefly the evidence
concerning his active participation in the waging of aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We turn now to the evidence showing that Defendant Funk
actively promoted the conspirators’ accession to power and their
consolidation of control over Germany. Soon after he joined the
Nazi Party in 1931 Defendant Funk began to hold important positions,
first within the Party itself and then within the Nazi
Government. Funk’s positions have, in the main, been listed in
Document Number 3533-PS, which is a statement signed by both
Defendant Funk and his counsel. This document has been made
available in the four working languages of these proceedings, and
a copy in the appropriate language should be available in each of
Your Honors’ document books. It is accordingly requested that this
document, which is Exhibit Number USA-651, be received into
evidence without the necessity of its being read in its entirety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your Honors will observe that there are some deletions and
reservations after some of the items listed in Document Number
3533-PS. These were inserted by Defendant Funk. The words which
he wished deleted are enclosed in parentheses. His comments are
underscored and followed by asterisks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We wished to avoid troubling the Tribunal with a detailed discussion
of all these contested points. Accordingly, we collected in
Document 3563-PS relevant excerpts from certain German publications.
This document has also been made available in the four
working languages. Moreover, we submit that the Tribunal can
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
properly take judicial notice of the publications referred to in the
document. However, in order to facilitate reference, we request that
it be received in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-652.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with Item “b” on the top of Page 1 of Document
Number 3533-PS—Your Honors will find that on Page 1 of the
document—Your Honors will observe that Defendant Funk has in
effect denied that he was Hitler’s personal economic adviser in the
1930’s. However, the excerpts from the four German publications
set forth on Pages 1 and 2 of Document Number 3563-PS directly
contradict this denial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We submit that it will be clear from the documents just referred
to that Defendant Funk, soon after he joined the Party, began to
operate as one of the Nazi inner circle. Moreover, as a Party
economic theorist during its critical days in 1932, he made a significant
contribution to its drive for mass support by drafting its
economic slogans. In this connection I would refer to Document
3505-PS, which is a biography entitled, in the English translation,
<span class='it'>Walter Funk—A Life for Economy</span>. This biography was written
by one Oestreich in German and published by the Central Publishing
House of the Nazi Party. I offer this document in evidence as
Exhibit Number USA-653. I wish to quote now from Page 1 of the
translation of this document, the center of the page. The corresponding
page of the German document is Page 81:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In 1931 he”—that is, Funk—“became a member of the
Reichstag. A document of his activity at the time is the
‘Economic Construction Program of the NSDAP’ which was
formulated by him in the second half of the year 1932. It
received the approval of Adolf Hitler and was declared binding
for all Gau leaders, speakers on the subject, and Gau
advisers on the subject and others of the Party.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Defendant Funk’s slogans became the economic gospel for
the Party organizers and spellbinders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Defendant Funk, however, was much more than one of the Nazi
Party’s economic theorists; he was also involved in the highly
practical work of soliciting campaign contributions for the Party.
As liaison man between the Party and the large German industrialists
he helped place the industrialists’ financial and political
support behind Hitler. Defendant Funk, in an interrogation conducted
on 4 June 1945, admitted that he helped finance the highly
critical campaign of 1932. I offer in evidence Document Number
2828-PS as Exhibit Number USA-654, and I quote from the bottom
of Page 43.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Lieutenant Meltzer, isn’t this really all
cumulative and detailed evidence to support what the Defendant
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
Funk has already agreed with reference to his office? On Page 1
you have there the admission that he was a member of the Nazi
Party, chief of the division of the Central Nazi Party, chairman of
the committee of the Nazi Party on economic policy, and then it
goes on from A to U with views of the various offices which he
held and which he admits, he held. But surely to go into the details
of those positions is unnecessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. MELTZER: If Your Honor pleases, the admission of the
various positions listed do not, in our judgment, indicate in any
way Defendant Funk’s participation in the fund-raising for the
Nazi Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The fund-raising?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. MELTZER: The fund-raising. Now, it is a possible inference
from those positions that he did engage in the solicitation of
campaign contributions. However, it did seem to us relevant to
mention most briefly direct evidence of that aspect of his activity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, if you say there is nothing in
these offices which covered the matter you are going to deal with;
well and good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. MELTZER: Defendant Funk, in an interrogation conducted
on 4 June 1945, admitted, as I said a minute ago, that he helped to
finance this highly critical campaign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You see, Lieutenant Meltzer, the heading
that you have so conveniently given to us is that he contributed to
the seizure of power. Well now, nearly every one of the headings
A to U on Page 1, which he admits, is evidence that he contributed
to seizure of power. Is it your object to propose that he also helped
to raise funds? The contribution to the seizure of power is not in
itself a crime; it is only a step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. MELTZER: Very well, Your Honor. There is one aspect,
however, of his activity in that regard which I should like to
mention; that is, in connection with his fund-raising activities, he
was present at a meeting in Berlin early in 1933.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am referring to the document which records what went on
in that meeting in order to point out that in the course of the
meeting Hitler and Göring submitted an exposition of certain basic
elements of the Nazi program. The reference to this meeting is
found in Document 2828-PS, which Your Honors will find on Page 28
of the document book. I wish to quote the following question and
answer:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘About 1933, we have been informed, certain industrialists
attended a meeting in the home of Göring before the election
in March. Do you know anything about this?’
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk267'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘I was at the meeting. Money was not demanded by
Göring but by Schacht. Hitler left the room, then Schacht
made a speech asking for money for the election. I was there
as an impartial observer, since I was friendly with the
industrialists.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The character and importance of Funk’s work with the large
industrialists is emphasized in the biography of Funk, which I
referred to earlier, and I will simply invite Your Honors’ attention
to the relevant pages of that book, which are 83 and 84.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I don’t understand why you read that
passage. If you wanted to show that he was at the meeting, it would
be merely sufficient to say that he was at the meeting. I don’t think
those two sentences that you read help us in the very least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. MELTZER: If the Tribunal please, those two sentences do
not refer to the meeting. Those two sentences refer to the biography
which sums up the Defendant Funk’s general contribution
to the Nazi accession to power and I thought it might be of interest
to the Tribunal to see the attitude of a German writer on this aspect
of the defendant’s career.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It seems to me you referred to the meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. MELTZER: I was referring Your Honors to Pages 32 and 33
of the document book, and to clarify this point may I read briefly
from the biography:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“No less important than Funk’s accomplishments in the programmatic
field in the years 1931 and 1932 was his activity
at that time as the Führer’s liaison man to the leading men
of the German industry, trade, commerce, and finance. On the
basis of his past work his personal relations to the German
economic leaders were broad and far-reaching. He was now
able to enlist them in the service of Adolf Hitler and not only
to answer their questions authoritatively but to convince
them and win their backing for the Party. At that time that
was terribly important work; every success achieved meant
a moral, political, and economic strengthening of the vitality
of the Party and contributed toward destroying the prejudice
that National Socialism is merely a party of class hatred
and class struggle.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Again, I don’t see that that has helped the
Tribunal in the least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. MELTZER: After Funk had helped Hitler become Chancellor,
as Press Chief of the German Government, he participated in
the early Cabinet meetings, in the course of which the conspirators
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
planned the strategy by which they would secure the passage
of the Presidential Emergency Decree, which was passed on 24 March
1933. Funk’s presence at these meetings is revealed by Document
2962-PS which has already been received in evidence and by Document
Number 2963-PS, offered as Exhibit Number USA-656. Your
Honors will recall that this decree marked the real seizure of
political power in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after this the Defendant Funk assumed an important role
in the Ministry of Propaganda. The record shows that the Ministry
became one of the most important and vicious of Nazi institutions
and that propaganda was fundamental to the achievement of the
Nazi program within Germany and outside of Germany. We do not
propose to review those matters to you but rather to present
evidence showing, as we have said, that the Defendant Funk took
a significant part in the propaganda operations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ministry was established on 13 March 1933, with Goebbels
as Chief and Defendant Funk as undersecretary, second in command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As undersecretary Defendant Funk was not only Goebbels’ chief
aide but was also the organizer of the large and complex propaganda
machine. I wish to offer in evidence Document Number
3501-PS, which will be found on Page 47 of your document book as
Exhibit Number USA-657. This document is an affidavit signed on
19 December 1945 by Max Amann, who held the position of Reich
Leader of the Press and President of the Reich Press Chamber. I
should like to read the second sentence of the first paragraph and
the entire second paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In carrying out my duties and responsibilities I became
familiar with the operation and the organization of the Reich
Ministry of Propaganda and Enlightenment. Funk was the
soul of the Ministry, and without him Goebbels could not
have built it up. Goebbels once stated to me that Funk was
his ‘most efficient man.’ Funk exercised comprehensive control
over all of the media of expression in Germany; over the
press, the theater, radio, and music. As Press Chief of the
Government and later as undersecretary of the Ministry,
Funk held daily meetings with the Führer and a daily press
conference in the course of which he issued the directives
governing the materials to be published by the German press.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to his position as undersecretary, Funk had many
other important jobs in the Propaganda Ministry and in its subordinate
agencies. These positions have already been listed in
Document 3533-PS. I wish, however, to refer in particular to Funk’s
position as vice-president of the Reich Chamber of Culture. This
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
position was, of course, related to his functions in the Propaganda
Ministry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his dual capacity he directly promoted two vital and related
Nazi policies. The first was the regimentation of all creative activities
in the interests of Nazi political and military objectives. The
second was the complete elimination of Jews and dissidents from
the so-called cultural professions. A full discussion of the methods
by which these policies were effectuated has been included in the
brief which was submitted as part of Document Book E. Accordingly,
we will not go into that matter now unless the Tribunal wishes us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of the Defendant Funk’s major role in the Propaganda
Ministry, it is natural to find Nazi writers stressing his responsibility
for the Nazi perversion of culture. In this connection, I will
simply invite the Tribunal’s attention to Pages 94 and 95 of Oestreich’s
biography, which has already been referred to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Defendant Funk left the Ministry of Propaganda and
became Minister of Economics in 1938, he continued to advance the
anti-Jewish program. For example, on 14 June 1938 he signed a
decree providing for the registration of Jewish enterprises. This
decree, which became the foundation for the ruthless economic persecution
which followed, is found in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1938,
Part I, Page 627. It is requested that the Tribunal take judicial
notice of this reference to the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> and all subsequent
references. May I add that the brief on Defendant Funk gives the
document numbers of translations of decrees and other German
publications of which the Tribunal will be requested to take judicial
notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would that be a convenient time to break off?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. MELTZER: Yes, Your Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Before we do so, Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, I
see that one of the counsel, Colonel Phillimore, I think, is proposing
to call certain witnesses. The Tribunal would like to know who
those witnesses are and what subject their evidence is going to
deal with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Would the Tribunal like to
know now? I would like to let them know, if it is convenient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If you could, it would be convenient now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes. The first witness is Korvettenkapitän
Moehle, who was a captain on Defendant Dönitz’
staff; and he will prove the passing on the Dönitz order of 17 September
1942. I think that is the main point that he deals with. I
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
think he deals also with the destruction of some rescue ships, but
that is the main point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second witness is Lieutenant Heisig. He will deal primarily
with lectures of the Defendant Dönitz in which he advocated the
destruction of the crews of merchant ships. That is the general
effect of the evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Lieutenant Meltzer, are you intending to call
any witnesses this afternoon?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. MELTZER: No, Sir. There is another member of the Prosecution,
Sir, who I believe is intending to call a witness—Mr. Dodd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: In connection with the case against Funk?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. MELTZER: No, Your Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Or in connection with the case against somebody
else?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. MELTZER: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Who is it in connection with, Raeder?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. MELTZER: I believe Mr. Dodd might offer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Raeder, is it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. MELTZER: No, Sir. Mr. Dodd might offer a better explanation
than I on the purpose of calling the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Dodd?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. THOMAS J. DODD (Executive Trial Counsel for the United
States): Yes, Sir. Your Honor, the witness is offered in connection
with the Defendants Rosenberg, Funk, Frick, Sauckel, and Kaltenbrunner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I see. The evidence relates to concentration
camps, does it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: It does, Your Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: This witness would have been called at the time
that we presented the other proof, except for the fact that he was
before the military court at Dachau at that time and was not
available.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I see; thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. MELTZER: May it please the Tribunal, before we adjourned
we were dealing with Defendant Funk’s role in the economic persecution
of the Jews. As Your Honors will recall, in November of
1938 the death of Vom Rath in Paris was exploited by the Nazis
as a pretext for intensifying the persecution of the Jews. The new
policy was directed at the complete elimination of the Jews from
the economic life of Germany. The evidence we will offer will
show that Defendant Funk took a significant part in both the
formulation and execution of that policy. In this connection I would
refer the Tribunal to Document Number 1816-PS which is already
in the Record. This document is a report of the meeting on the
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
Jewish question. It will be found, Your Honor, on Page 52 of the
document book. This meeting was held under Göring’s chairmanship
on 12 November 1938. In opening the meeting, Defendant
Göring stated—and I quote now from Page 1, Paragraph 1, of the
translation; the corresponding page of the German document is also
Page 1:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. today’s meeting is of a decisive nature. I have received
a letter written by the chief of staff of the Führer’s Deputy,
Bormann, on the Führer’s orders directing that the Jewish
question be now, once and for all, co-ordinated and solved
one way or another.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Defendant Funk came to this meeting well prepared. He had
a law already drafted which he submitted with the following
explanation—I quote again from Document 1816-PS, Page 15:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have prepared a law for this case which provides that as
from 1 January 1939 Jews shall be prohibited from operating
retail stores and mail-order establishments as well as independent
workshops. They shall be further prohibited from
hiring employees for that purpose or offering any goods on
the market. Wherever a Jewish shop is operated, it is to be
closed by the police. From 1 January 1939 a Jew can no
longer operate a business in the sense of the law for the
regulation of national labor of 20 January 1934.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I believe we may omit the rest. It is all in the same tenor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. MELTZER: The substance of Defendant Funk’s draft law
promptly found its way into the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>. On 12 November
1938 Defendant Göring signed a decree entitled, and I quote,
“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the Elimination of Jews from German Economic Life,” and
in Section 4 he authorized Defendant Funk to implement the provisions
of the decree by issuing the necessary rules and regulations.
An examination of the provisions of this decree, which is set forth
in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> 1938, Part I, Page 1580, will reveal how
well it deserved its title “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the Elimination of the Jews from
German Economic Life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after the passage of the decree of 12 November, Defendant
Funk delivered a speech on the Jewish question. He made it clear
that the program of economic persecution was part of the larger
program of extermination and he boasted of the fact that the new
program insured the complete elimination of Jews from the German
economy. I offer into evidence Document Number 3545-PS as
Exhibit USA-659. This document, which is found on Page 76 of
the document book, is a certified photostatic copy of Page 2 of
the <span class='it'>Frankfurter Zeitung</span> of 17 November 1938. I quote a very brief
portion of that speech:
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“State and economy constitute a single unit. They must be
directed according to the same principles. The best proof of
this is given by the most recent development of the Jewish
problem in Germany. One cannot exclude the Jews from
political life and yet let them live and work in the economic
sphere.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall omit the rest, with the request that the Tribunal take
judicial notice of this reprint from the German newspaper, the
<span class='it'>Frankfurter Zeitung</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish, however, to refer to only one more decree, signed by
Defendant Funk himself. On the 3rd of December 1938 he signed
a decree which imposed additional and drastic economic disabilities
upon the Jews and subjected their property to confiscation and
forced liquidation. This decree is set forth in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>
1938, Part I, Page 1709. Defendant Funk himself has admitted and
deplored his responsibility for the economic persecution of the
Jews. I offer into evidence Document Number 3544-PS, as Exhibit
USA-660. This document, which is the last document in connection
with this phase of the case, is an interrogation of Defendant Funk
dated 22 October 1945. Your Honors will find it on Pages 102 and
103 of the document book. I wish to quote from Pages 26 to 27
of the interrogation. The corresponding page of the German translation
is Page 21. Although I propose to quote enough to place
Defendant Funk’s statements in their proper context, I do not, of
course, intend to give any credence to his attempts at self-justification:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘All the decrees excluding the Jews from industry were
yours, were they not?’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Now, omitting the first nine lines of the reply:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘As far as my participation in this Jewish affair is concerned,
that was my responsibility, and I regretted later on
that I ever participated. The Party had always brought
pressure to bear on me to make me agree to the confiscation
of Jewish property, and I refused repeatedly. But later on,
when the anti-Jewish measures and the brutality against
Jews were being carried out with full force, something legal
had to be done to prevent the looting and confiscation of the
whole of Jewish property.’</p>
<hr class='tbk268'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘You knew that the looting and all that was done at the
instigation of the Party, didn’t you?’</p>
<hr class='tbk269'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Here Defendant Funk wept and answered:</p>
<hr class='tbk270'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘That is when I should have resigned, in 1938. I am guilty.
I am guilty. I admit that I am a guilty party here.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the Propaganda Ministry, Defendant Funk, as we have seen,
helped solidify the German people in favor of war. When he
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
moved on to his position as Minister of Economics, and to other
positions which will appear, he used his talents even more directly
for the conspirators’ main task: preparation for war. Immediately
before Defendant Funk took over the Ministry of Economics from
Defendant Schacht in 1938, there was a major reorganization of that
ministry’s functions which integrated it with the Four Year Plan
as the supreme command of the German military economy. This
reorganization was effected by a decree, dated 4 February 1938,
signed by Göring as Commissioner of the Four Year Plan. This
decree is set forth in an official monthly bulletin issued by Göring
and entitled, in the English translation, <span class='it'>The Four Year Plan</span>,
Volume II, 1938, Page 105. It is requested that the Tribunal take
judicial notice of this publication.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point I would simply note that that decree makes it
clear that Defendant Funk assumed a critical role in the task of
economic mobilization during a decisive period. Indeed, in 1938
he was directly charged with the task of preparing the German
economy for war. By a secret decree he was made Plenipotentiary
General for Economics and assumed the duties which once had
been discharged by Defendant Schacht. In this connection I refer
to Document 2194-PS, which has already been placed in evidence.
This document, which is found on Page 111 of Your Honors’ document
books, consists of a letter dated 6 September 1939, and that
letter transmitted a copy of the Reich Defense Law of 4 September
1938. It is this enclosure that we wish to deal with now. I wish
to quote from Page 4 of the translation, Paragraphs 2 to 4:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is the task of the GBW”—that is the Plenipotentiary
General for Economics—“to put all economic forces into the
service of the Reich defense and to safeguard economically
the life of the German nation. To him are subordinated: the
Reich Minister of Economics, the Reich Minister of Food and
Agriculture, the Reich Minister of Labor.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” and so on.—“He
is furthermore responsible for directing the financing of
the Reich defense within the realm of the Reich Finance
Ministry and the Reichsbank.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To quote one more paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The GBW must fulfill the demands of the OKW which are
of essential importance for the Armed Forces and must
ensure the economic conditions necessary for the production
of the armament industry directly managed by the OKW,
according to the requirements of the latter.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This law, in essence, re-enacted the provisions previously passed
in the Reich Defense Law of 1935, and I will not trouble the
Tribunal with further reading. I do wish to note, however, that
the law was, at the specific direction of Hitler, kept secret and that
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
it was signed by Defendant Funk, among others, as Plenipotentiary
General for Economics. Your Honors will find Defendant Funk’s
signature on the next to the last page of the document, and I invite
your attention to the names of his co-signers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Defendant Funk, in a speech which he delivered on 14 October
1939, explained how, as Plenipotentiary General for Economics, he
had for a year and a half prior to the launching of the aggression
against Poland, advanced Germany’s economic preparations for
war. I offer into evidence Document Number 3324-PS as Exhibit
USA-661. This document is a German book by Berndt and Von
Wedel entitled, in the English translation, <span class='it'>Germany in the Fight</span>.
That book reprints the defendant’s speech. I quote now from Page 2
of the translation of Document Number 3324-PS, which is found
on Page 116 of the document book. The translation of this speech
is somewhat awkward, and with the Tribunal’s permission I would
rephrase it somewhat without changing its substance in the
slightest.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Although all economic and financial departments were
harnessed to the task of the Four Year Plan under the
leadership of General Field Marshal Göring, Germany’s
economic preparation for war was also secretly advanced in
another sector for well over a year, namely, through the
formation of a national guiding apparatus for special war
economy tasks which would have to be accomplished the
moment that war became a fact. For this work all economic
departments were combined into one administrative authority,
the Plenipotentiary General for Economics, to which
position the Führer appointed me one and a half years ago.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What was the date of that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. MELTZER: The date of that speech, Sir, is 14 October 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his dual capacity as Plenipotentiary General for Economics
and Minister of Economics, Defendant Funk was naturally advised
of the requirements which the conspirators’ program of aggression
imposed on the German economy. In this connection I would invite
the Tribunal’s attention to Document Number 1301-PS, which is
already in evidence. As Your Honors will recall, this document
is a top secret report of the conference held in Defendant Göring’s
office on 14 October 1938. Your Honors will find it on Page 142
of the document book. I shall simply summarize the relevant
portions of this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the conference Göring referred to the world situation
and to Hitler’s directive to organize a gigantic armament program.
He thereupon directed the Ministry of Economics to increase exports
in order to obtain the foreign exchange necessary for stepping up
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
armament. He added, as Your Honors will recall, that the Luftwaffe
must be increased five-fold, that the Navy should arm more
quickly, and that the Army should accelerate the production of
weapons for attack. Defendant Göring’s words directed at Funk,
among others, were the words of a man already at war; and his
emphasis on quintupling the Air Force and on weapons for attack
was that of a man waging aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Schacht’s departure Funk was a key figure in the preparation
of plans to finance the war. This was natural, since
Defendant Funk after 1939 occupied three positions crucial to war
finance. Two we have already named: Minister of Economics and
Plenipotentiary General for Economics. In addition, he was
President of the Reichsbank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Funk’s role in war financing is illustrated by Document Number
3562-PS, which I now offer in evidence as Exhibit USA-662. This
document was found in the captured files of the Reich Ministry of
Economics. It consists, in part, of a letter from the Plenipotentiary
General for Economics, signed on his behalf by Dr. Posse. The
letter is dated 1 June 1939 and encloses the minutes of a conference
concerning the financing of the war which was held under the
chairmanship of Funk’s undersecretary in the Ministry of Economics,
Dr. Landfried. A copy of the document which I have offered
into evidence bears a marginal note on Page 1 in the bottom lefthand
corner, dated 5 June, stating, and I quote: “To be shown to
the Minister,”—that is, Funk—“for his information.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the course of the meeting, which was attended by
12 officials, five of whom were directly responsible to Defendant
Funk in his various capacities, the conferees discussed a
memorandum regarding war finance which had been prepared by
the Plenipotentiary General for Economics on May 9, 1939. I wish
to quote briefly from Page 2 of the English translation, which is
found on Page 153 of Your Honors’ document book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Then a report was made of the contents of the ‘Notes on
the question of Internal Financing of War’ of 9 May of this
year, in which the figures given to me by the Reich Minister
of Finance were also discussed. It was pointed out that the
Plenipotentiary General for Economics is primarily interested
in introducing into the legislation for war finance the idea
of financing war expenditures by future revenues to be
expected after the war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And, if I may quote another brief excerpt from this important
memorandum, which is found on Page 2 of the English translation,
Page 153 of your document books:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“State Secretary Neumann first submitted for discussion
the question of whether, in case of war, production would
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
be able to meet, to the extent supposed, the demands of
the Armed Forces, especially if the demands of the Armed
Forces, as stated in the above report, should increase to
approximately 14,000 millions in the first 3 months of war.
He stated that if the production potential of the present Reich
territory is taken as a basis he doubts the possibility of such
an increase.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is plain then that Defendant Funk exercised comprehensive
authority over large areas of the German economy whose proper
organization and direction were critical to effective war preparation.
The once powerful military machine which rested on the foundation
of thorough economic preparation was a tribute to the contribution
which Defendant Funk had made to Nazi aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Funk made this contribution with full knowledge of the
plans for military aggression. A compelling inference of such
knowledge would arise from the combination of several factors:
From Funk’s long and intimate association with the Nazi inner
circle; from the very nature of his official functions; from the war-dominated
setting of Nazi Germany; from the fact that force and the
threat of force had become the primary and the open instruments
of German foreign policy. And the final element in weighing the
question of Defendant Funk’s knowledge is, of course, the fact
that, at the same time that Defendant Funk was making economic
preparation, specific plans for aggression were being formulated—plans
which were carried out and plans which could be effectively
carried out only if they were synchronized with the complementary
economic measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conclusion concerning Defendant Funk’s knowledge is reinforced
beyond any question by considering, in the light of the factors
described above, the more specific and direct evidence which has
already been placed into the Record. We have seen from Document
1760-PS that Defendant Funk had told Mr. Messersmith that
the absorption of Austria by Germany was a political and economic
necessity, and that it would be achieved by whatever means were
necessary. We have already referred to Document Number 1301-PS,
in which Defendant Göring laid down directives which could be
understood only as directives to prepare the economic basis for
aggression. And Document Number 3562-PS has revealed that
Defendant Funk was making detailed plans for financing the war,
that is, of course, a particular war, the war against Poland. In
this connection I wish to refer to another vital piece of evidence
which has already been introduced in the Record. It is the letter
dated 25 August 1939 which Defendant Funk wrote to Hitler. In
that letter, as Your Honors will recall, Defendant Funk expressed
his gratitude at being able to experience those world-shaking times
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
and to contribute to those tremendous events. And he thanked
Hitler for approving his proposals designed to prepare the German
economy for the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, the Record contains evidence showing that Defendant
Funk, both personally and through his representatives, participated
in the economic planning which preceded the military aggression
against the Soviet Union. I would refer the Tribunal to Document
1039-PS, which revealed that in April of 1941 Defendant Rosenberg,
who had been appointed deputy for the centralized treatment
of problems related to the occupation of the Eastern territories,
that is, the Soviet Union, discussed with Defendant Funk the
economic problems which would arise when the plans for aggression
in the East matured. And Document 1039-PS also reveals that
Defendant Funk appointed one Dr. Schlotterer as his deputy to
collaborate with Rosenberg in connection with the exploitation of
the Eastern territories and that Schlotterer met with Defendant
Rosenberg almost daily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is clear, then, that Defendant Funk participated in every
phase of the conspirators’ program, from their seizure of power
to their final defeat. Throughout he worked effectively, if sometimes
more quietly than others, on behalf of the Nazi program,
a program which from the very beginning he knew contemplated
the use of ruthless terror and force within Germany and, if necessary,
outside of Germany. He bears, we submit, a special, a direct,
and a heavy responsibility for the commission of Crimes against
Humanity, Crimes against Peace, and War Crimes. The Record
makes it clear, if we may summarize the evidence, that by virtue
of his activities in the Ministry of Propaganda and in the Ministry
of Economics he is responsible for stimulating and engaging in
the unrelenting persecution of the Jews and other minorities, for
psychologically mobilizing the German people for aggressive war,
and for weakening the willingness and capacity of the conspirators’
intended victims to resist aggression. It is also clear, we submit,
that Defendant Funk, with full knowledge of the conspirators’
purposes, in his capacity as Minister of Economics, President of
the Reichsbank, and Plenipotentiary General for Economics, actively
participated in the mobilization of the German economy for
aggression. In these capacities and as a member of the Ministerial
Council for Defense and the Central Planning Board he also participated
in the waging of aggressive war. Moreover, by virtue of
his membership in the Central Planning Board, which, as Your
Honors will recall from Mr. Dodd’s presentation, formulated and
directed the program for the enslavement, the exploitation, and
degradation of millions of foreign workers, Defendant Funk also
shares special responsibility for the Nazi slave-labor program.
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The French Prosecution, I am informed, will deal with this
matter in greater detail. Moreover, the French and Soviet Prosecution
will submit evidence showing that Defendant Funk actively
participated in the program for the criminal looting of the
resources of occupied territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: May it please the Tribunal, we would like to call
at this time the witness, Dr. Franz Blaha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness, Blaha, took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT [<span class='it'>To the witness</span>]: Is your name Franz Blaha?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRANZ BLAHA (Witness) [<span class='it'>In Czech.</span>]: Dr. Franz Blaha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath: “I swear by God—the
Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the truth, the
pure truth—and will withhold and add nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You can sit down if you wish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: You are Dr. Franz Blaha, a native and a citizen
of Czechoslovakia, are you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: [<span class='it'>In Czech.</span>] Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I understand that you are able to speak German,
and for technical reasons I suggest that we conduct this examination
in German, although I know your native tongue is Czech;
is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: [<span class='it'>In Czech.</span>] In the interest of the case I am willing
to testify in German for the following reasons: 1. For the past
7 years, which are the subject of my testimony, I have lived
exclusively in German surroundings; 2. A large number of special
and technical expressions relating to life in and about the concentration
camps are purely German inventions, and no appropriate
equivalent for them in any other language can be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Dr. Blaha, by education and training and profession
you are a doctor of medicine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: [<span class='it'>In German.</span>] Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: And in 1939 you were the head of a hospital in
Czechoslovakia?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: You were arrested, were you not, by the Germans
in 1939 after they occupied Czechoslovakia?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: And were you confined in various prisons between
1939 and 1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: From 1941 to April of 1945 you were confined at
Dachau Concentration Camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes, until the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: When that camp was liberated by the Allied Forces?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: You executed an affidavit in Nuremberg on the
9th day of January of this year, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: This affidavit, if it please the Tribunal, bears the
Document Number 3249-PS, and I wish to offer it at this time.
It is Exhibit USA-663. I feel that we can reduce the extent of
this interrogation by approximately three-fourths through the submission
of this affidavit and I should like to read it. It will take
much less time to read this affidavit than it would to go through
it in question and answer form and it covers a large part of what
we expect to elicit from this witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I wouldn’t have read it if we had had time to
have a Russian and French translation, but unfortunately that
wasn’t possible in the few days we had.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I, Franz Blaha, being duly sworn, depose and state as
follows:</p>
<hr class='tbk271'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. I studied medicine in Prague, Vienna, Strasbourg, and
Paris and received my diploma in 1920. From 1920 to 1926
I was a clinical assistant. In 1926 I became chief physician
of the Iglau Hospital in Moravia, Czechoslovakia. I held
this position until 1939 when the Germans entered Czechoslovakia
and I was seized as a hostage and held a prisoner
for co-operating with the Czech Government. I was sent as
a prisoner to the Dachau Concentration Camp in April 1941
and remained there until the liberation of the camp in
April 1945. Until July 1941 I worked in a punishment
company. After that I was sent to the hospital and subjected
to the experiments in typhoid being conducted by Dr. Muermelstadt.
After that I was to be made the subject of an experimental
operation and succeeded in avoiding this only by
admitting that I was a physician. If this had been known
before, I would have suffered, because intellectuals were
treated very harshly in the punishment company. In October
1941 I was sent to work in the herb plantation and later in
the laboratory for processing herbs. In June 1942 I was
taken into the hospital as a surgeon. Shortly afterwards I was
directed to perform a stomach operation on 20 healthy
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
prisoners. Because I would not do this I was transferred to
the autopsy room where I stayed until April 1945. While
there I performed approximately 7,000 autopsies. In all,
12,000 autopsies were performed under my direction.</p>
<hr class='tbk272'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. From the middle of 1941 to the end of 1942 some 500
operations on healthy prisoners were performed. These
were for the instructions of the SS medical students and
doctors and included operations on the stomach, gall bladder,
and throat. These were performed by students and doctors
of only 2 years’ training, although they were very dangerous
and difficult. Ordinarily they would not have been done
except by surgeons with at least 4 years’ surgical practice.
Many prisoners died on the operating table and many others
from later complications. I performed autopsies on all of
these bodies. The doctors who supervised these operations
were Lang, Muermelstadt, Wolter, Ramsauer, and Kahr.
Standartenführer Dr. Lolling frequently witnessed these
operations.</p>
<hr class='tbk273'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. During my time at Dachau I was familiar with many
kinds of medical experiments carried on there on human
victims. These persons were never volunteers but were
forced to submit to such acts. Malaria experiments on about
1,200 people were conducted by Dr. Klaus Schilling between
1941 and 1945. Schilling was personally ordered by Himmler
to conduct these experiments. The victims were either
bitten by mosquitoes or given injections of malaria sporozoites
taken from mosquitoes. Different kinds of treatment
were applied including quinine, pyrifer, neosalvarsan,
antipyrin, pyramidon, and a drug called 2516 Behring.
I performed autopsies on the bodies of people who died
from these malaria experiments. Thirty to 40 died from
the malaria itself. Three hundred to four hundred died later
from diseases which were fatal because of the physical
condition resulting from the malaria attacks. In addition
there were deaths resulting from poisoning due to overdoses
of neosalvarsan and pyramidon. Dr. Schilling was
present at my autopsies on the bodies of his patients.</p>
<hr class='tbk274'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4. In 1942 and 1943 experiments on human beings were
conducted by Dr. Sigmund Rascher to determine the effects
of changing air pressure. As many as 25 persons were put
at one time into a specially constructed van in which pressure
could be increased or decreased as required. The purpose
was to find out the effects on human beings of high altitude
and of rapid descents by parachute. Through a window in the
van I have seen the people lying on the floor of the van.
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
Most of the prisoners used died from these experiments, from
internal hemorrhage of the lungs or brain. The survivors
coughed blood when taken out. It was my job to take the
bodies out and as soon as they were found to be dead to
send the internal organs to Munich for study. About 400 to
500 prisoners were experimented on. The survivors were
sent to invalid blocks and liquidated shortly afterwards.
Only a few escaped.</p>
<hr class='tbk275'/>
<p class='noindent'>“5. Rascher also conducted experiments on the effect of cold
water on human beings. This was done to find a way for
reviving airmen who had fallen into the ocean. The subject
was placed in ice-cold water and kept there until he was
unconscious. Blood was taken from his neck and tested each
time his body temperature dropped one degree. This drop
was determined by a rectal thermometer. Urine was also
periodically tested. Some men stood it as long as 24 to
36 hours. The lowest body temperature reached was 19
degrees centigrade, but most men died at 25 or 26 degrees.
When the men were removed from the ice water attempts
were made to revive them by artificial sunshine, with hot
water, by electro-therapy, or by animal warmth. For this
last experiment prostitutes were used and the body of the
unconscious man was placed between the bodies of two
women. Himmler was present at one such experiment.
I could see him from one of the windows in the street
between the blocks. I have personally been present at some
of these cold water experiments when Rascher was absent,
and I have seen notes and diagrams on them in Rascher’s
laboratory. About 300 persons were used in these experiments.
The majority died. Of those who survived, many
became mentally deranged. Those who did not die were
sent to invalid blocks and were killed just as were the
victims of the air pressure experiments. I know only two
who survived, a Yugoslav and a Pole, both of whom are
mental cases.</p>
<hr class='tbk276'/>
<p class='noindent'>“6. Liver puncture experiments were performed by Dr.
Brachtl on healthy people and on people who had diseases
of the stomach and gall bladder. For this purpose a needle
was jabbed into the liver of a person and a small piece of
the liver was extracted. No anaesthetic was used. The
experiment is very painful and often had serious results,
as the stomach or large blood vessels were often punctured,
resulting in hemorrhage. Many persons died of these tests
for which Polish, Russian, Czech, and German prisoners
were employed. Altogether about 175 people were subjected
to these experiments.
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk277'/>
<p class='noindent'>“7. Phlegmone experiments were conducted by Dr. Schütz,
Dr. Babor, Dr. Kieselwetter and Professor Lauer. Forty
healthy men were used at a time, of which twenty were
given intramuscular and twenty intravenous injections of
pus from diseased persons. All treatment was forbidden for
3 days, by which time serious inflammation and in many
cases general blood poisoning had occurred. Then each group
was divided again into groups of 10. Half were given
chemical treatment with liquid and special pills every
10 minutes for 24 hours. The remainder were treated with
sulfanamide and surgery. In some cases all the limbs were
amputated. My autopsy also showed that the chemical
treatment had been harmful and had even caused perforations
of the stomach wall. For these experiments Polish,
Czech, and Dutch priests were ordinarily used. Pain was
intense in such experiments. Most of the 600 to 800 persons
who were used finally died. Most of the others became
permanent invalids and were later killed.</p>
<hr class='tbk278'/>
<p class='noindent'>“8. In the fall of 1944 there were 60 to 80 persons who were
subjected to salt water experiments. They were locked in a
room and for 5 days were given nothing for food but salt
water. During this time their urine, blood, and excrement
were tested. None of these prisoners died, possibly because
they received smuggled food from other prisoners. Hungarians
and Gypsies were used for these experiments.</p>
<hr class='tbk279'/>
<p class='noindent'>“9. It was common practice to remove the skin from dead
prisoners. I was commanded to do this on many occasions.
Dr. Rascher and Dr. Wolter in particular asked for this human
skin from human backs and chests. It was chemically treated
and placed in the sun to dry. After that it was cut into various
sizes for use as saddles, riding breeches, gloves, house slippers,
and ladies’ handbags. Tattooed skin was especially valued
by SS men. Russians, Poles, and other inmates were used in
this way, but it was forbidden to cut out the skin of a German.
This skin had to be from healthy prisoners and free from
defects. Sometimes we did not have enough bodies with good
skin and Rascher would say, ‘All right, you will get the
bodies.’ The next day we would receive 20 or 30 bodies of
young people. They would have been shot in the neck or
struck on the head so that the skin would be uninjured. Also
we frequently got requests for the skulls or skeletons of
prisoners. In those cases we boiled the skull or the body.
Then the soft parts were removed and the bones were
bleached and dried and reassembled. In the case of skulls it
was important to have a good set of teeth. When we got an
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
order for skulls from Oranienburg the SS men would say,
‘We will try to get you some with good teeth.’ So it was
dangerous to have good skin or good teeth.</p>
<hr class='tbk280'/>
<p class='noindent'>“10. Transports arrived frequently in Dachau from Struthof,
Belsen, Auschwitz, Mauthausen and other camps. Many of
these were 10 to 14 days on the way without water or food.
On one transport which arrived in November 1942 I found
evidence of cannibalism. The living persons had eaten the
flesh from the dead bodies. Another transport arrived
from Compiègne in France. Professor Limousin of Clermont-Ferrand
who was later my assistant told me that there had
been 2,000 persons on this transport when it started. There
was food available but no water. Eight hundred died on the
way and were thrown out. When it arrived after 12 days,
more than 500 persons were dead on the train. Of the remainder
most died shortly after arrival. I investigated this
transport because the International Red Cross complained,
and the SS men wanted a report that the deaths had been
caused by fighting and rioting on the way. I dissected a
number of bodies and found that they had died from suffocation
and lack of water. It was mid-summer and 120 people
had been packed into each car.</p>
<hr class='tbk281'/>
<p class='noindent'>“11. In 1941 and 1942 we had in the camp what we called
invalid transports. These were made up of people who were
sick or for some reason incapable of working. We called
them ‘Himmelfahrt Commandos.’ About 100 or 120 were
ordered each week to go to the shower baths. There four
people gave injections of phenol, evipan, or benzine, which
soon caused death. After 1943 these invalids were sent to
other camps for liquidation. I know that they were killed,
because I saw the records and they were marked with a
cross and the date that they left, which was the way that
deaths were ordinarily recorded. This was shown on both the
card index of the Camp Dachau and the records in the registry
office of Dachau. One thousand to two thousand went away
every 3 months, so there were about five thousand sent to
death in this way in 1943, and the same in 1944. In April
1945 a Jewish transport was loaded at Dachau and was left
standing on the railroad siding. The station was destroyed
by bombing, and they could not leave. So they were just
left there to die of starvation. They were not allowed to get
off. When the camp was liberated they were all dead.</p>
<hr class='tbk282'/>
<p class='noindent'>“12. Many executions by gas or shooting or injections took
place right in the camp. The gas chamber was completed in
1944, and I was called by Dr. Rascher to examine the first
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
victims. Of the eight or nine persons in the chamber there
were three still alive, and the remainder appeared to be
dead. Their eyes were red, and their faces were swollen.
Many prisoners were later killed in this way. Afterwards
they were removed to the crematorium where I had to
examine their teeth for gold. Teeth containing gold were
extracted. Many prisoners who were sick were killed by
injections while in the hospital. Some prisoners killed in the
hospital came through to the autopsy room with no name or
number on the tag which was usually tied to their big toe.
Instead the tag said ‘Do not dissect’. I performed autopsies on
some of these and found that they were perfectly healthy but
had died from injections. Sometimes prisoners were killed
only because they had dysentery or vomited and gave the
nurses too much trouble. Mental patients were liquidated by
being led to the gas chamber and injected there or shot.
Shooting was a common method of execution. Prisoners could
be shot just outside the crematorium and carried in. I have
seen people pushed into the ovens while they were still
breathing and making sounds, although if they were too
much alive they were usually hit on the head first.</p>
<hr class='tbk283'/>
<p class='noindent'>“13. The principal executions about which I know from having
examined the victims or supervised such examinations are
as follows:</p>
<hr class='tbk284'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In 1942 there were 5,000 to 6,000 Russians held in a separate
camp inside Dachau. They were taken on foot to the military
rifle range near the camp in groups of 500 or 600 and shot.
Such groups left the camp about three times a week. At night
we used to go out to bring the bodies back in carts and then
examine them. In February 1944 about 40 Russian students
arrived from Moosburg. I knew a few of the boys in the
hospital. I examined their bodies after they were shot outside
the crematory. In September 1944 a group of 94 high-ranking
Russian officers were shot, including two military doctors
who had been working with me in the hospital. I examined
their bodies. In April 1945, a number of prominent people
were shot who had been kept in the bunker. They included
two French generals, whose names I cannot remember; but
I recognized them from their uniform. I examined them after
they were shot. In 1944 and 1945 a number of women were
killed by hanging, shooting, and injections. I examined them
and found that in many cases they were pregnant. In 1945,
just before the camp was liberated, all ‘Nacht und Nebel’
prisoners were executed. These were prisoners who were
forbidden to have any contact with the outside world. They
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
were kept in a special enclosure and were not allowed to
send or receive any mail. There were 30 or 40, many of
whom were sick. These were carried to the crematory on
stretchers. I examined them and found they had all been shot
in the neck.</p>
<hr class='tbk285'/>
<p class='noindent'>“14. From 1941 on the camp was more and more overcrowded.
In 1943 the hospital for prisoners was already overcrowded.
In 1944 and in 1945 it was impossible to maintain any sort
of sanitary conditions. Rooms which held 300 or 400 persons
in 1942 were filled with 1,000 in 1943, and in the first quarter
of 1945 with 2,000 or more. The rooms could not be cleaned
because they were too crowded and there was no cleaning
material. Baths were available only once a month. Latrine
facilities were completely inadequate. Medicine was almost
nonexistent. But I found after the camp was liberated that
there was plenty of medicine in the SS hospital for all the
camp, if it had been given to us for use. New arrivals at the
camp were lined up out of doors for hours at a time. Sometimes
they stood there from morning until night. It did not
matter whether this was in the winter or in the summer.
This occurred all through 1943, 1944, and the first quarter of
1945. I could see these formations from the window of the
autopsy room. Many of the people who had to stand in the
cold in this way became ill with pneumonia and died. I had
several acquaintances who were killed in this manner during
1944 and 1945.</p>
<hr class='tbk286'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In October 1944 a transport of Hungarians brought spotted
fever into the camp, and an epidemic began. I examined
many of the corpses from this transport and reported the
situation to Dr. Hintermayer but was forbidden, on penalty
of being shot, to mention that there was an epidemic in the
camp. He said that it was sabotage, and that I was trying to
have the camp quarantined so that the prisoners would not
have to work in the armaments industry. No preventive
measures were taken at all. New healthy arrivals were put
into blocks where an epidemic was already present. Also
infected persons were put into these blocks. The 30th block,
for instance, died out completely three times. Only at Christmas,
when the epidemic spread into the SS camp, was a
quarantine established. Nevertheless, transports continued to
arrive. We had 200 to 300 new typhus cases a day and about
100 deaths from typhus daily. In all we had 28,000 cases and
15,000 deaths. Apart from those that died from the disease
my autopsies showed that many deaths were caused solely
by malnutrition. Such deaths occurred in all the years from
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
1941 to 1945. They were mostly Italians, Russians, and
Frenchmen. These people were just starved to death. At the
time of death they weighed 50 to 60 pounds. Autopsies showed
their internal organs had often shrunk to one-third of their
normal size.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: [<span class='it'>Continuing the interrogation.</span>] Dr. Blaha, will you
state whether or not visitors came to the camp of Dachau while
you were there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Very many visitors came to our camp so that it sometimes
seemed to us that we were not confined in a camp but in an
exhibition or a zoo. At times there was a visit or an excursion
almost every day from schools, from different military, medical, and
other institutions, and also many members of the Police, the SS,
and the Armed Forces; also.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you pause so as to give the interpreter’s
words time to come through; do you understand?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes. Also some State personalities came to the camp.
Regular inspections were made month by month by the Inspector
General of Concentration Camps, Obergruppenführer Pohl; also by
SS Reichsführer Professor Grawitz, Inspector of Experimental Stations;
Standartenführer Dr. Lolling; and other personalities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: The presiding Justice has suggested that you pause,
and it would be helpful if you paused in the making of your answers
so that the interpreters can complete their interpretation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Are you able to state how long these visits lasted
on an average?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: That depended on the sort of visits being made. Some
were inside for half an hour to an hour, some for 3 or 4 hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Were there prominent Government people who
visited the camp at any time while you were there?</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: While I was there many personalities came to our
camp: Reichsführer Himmler came to Dachau several times and
also was present at the experiments. I was present myself on these
occasions. Other personalities also were there. I myself have seen
three ministers of state, and from political prisoners who were
Germans and therefore knew these people I heard that several other
personages visited the camp. I also twice saw high-ranking Italian
officers and once a Japanese officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Do you remember the names of any of these prominent
Government people, or do you remember more particularly
who any of them were?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Besides Himmler there was Bormann; also Gauleiter
Wagner; Gauleiter Giesler; State Ministers Frick, Rosenberg, Funk,
Sauckel; also the General of Police Daluege; and others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Did these people whom you have just named take
tours around the camp while you were there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Generally the tour through the camp was so arranged
that the visitors were first taken to the kitchen, then to the laundry,
then to the hospital, that is, usually to the surgical station, then to
the malaria station of Professor Schilling and the experimental
station of Dr. Rascher. Then they proceeded to a few “blocks,”
particularly those of the German prisoners and sometimes they also
visited the chapel, which, however, had been fitted up inside for
German clergy only. Sometimes, too, various personalities were
presented and introduced to the visitors. It was so arranged that
always, first of all, a “green” professional criminal was selected and
introduced as a murderer; then the Mayor of Vienna, Dr. Schmitz,
was usually presented as the second one; then a high-ranking Czech
officer; then a homosexual; a Gypsy; a Catholic bishop or other
Polish priest of high rank; then a university professor, in this order,
so that the visitors always found it entertaining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Now did I understand you to name Kaltenbrunner
as one of those visitors there or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes, Kaltenbrunner was also present. He was there
together with General Daluege. That was, I believe, in the year 1943.
I was also interested in General Daluege because it was he who,
after Heydrich’s death, had become Protector of Bohemia and
Moravia, and I wanted to see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Did you see Kaltenbrunner there yourself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes. He was pointed out to me. I had not seen him
previously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Did I understand you mentioned the name Frick as
one of those whom you saw there?
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes, it was in the year of 1944, the first half of 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Where did you see him? Where in the camp did
you see him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I saw him from the hospital window as he was entering
with his staff, with several people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Do you see the man whom you saw there that day,
by the name of Frick, in this courtroom now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes, the fourth man from the right in the first row.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I understand you also named the name Rosenberg
as one of those whom you saw there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I can recall that it was shortly after my arrival in the
concentration camp at Dachau that there was a visit and it was
then that my German comrades pointed Rosenberg out to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Do you see that man in this courtroom now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes. He is the second farther to the left in the first row.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I also understood you to name Sauckel as one of
those who were present in the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes, but I did not see him personally; I merely heard
that he had also visited certain factories and armament plants; and
that was in 1943, I believe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Was it general knowledge in the camp at that time
that a man named Sauckel visited the camp, and particularly the
munition plant?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes, that was general knowledge in the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I also understood you to name one of those who
visited this camp as Funk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes. He was also present at a visit, and I can
remember that it was on the occasion of a state conference of the
Axis Powers in Salzburg or Reichenhall. It was the custom on
such occasions, when there was a Party convention or a celebration
in Munich, Berchtesgaden, or Salzburg, for several personalities to
come from the celebrations to Dachau for a visit. That was also
the case with Funk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Did you personally see Funk there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: No, I did not see Funk personally; I merely heard
that he was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Was that general knowledge in the camp at that
time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes. We knew beforehand that he was to come.
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Were there any visits after the end of the year
1944, or in the months of 1945?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: There were some visits still, but very few, because
there was a typhus epidemic in the camp at that time and quarantine
was imposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Doctor, you are now director of a hospital in
Prague, are you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I have no further questions to ask of the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any other counsel for the Prosecution
wish to ask any questions? Colonel Pokrovsky? [<span class='it'>Colonel

</div>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>COLONEL Y. V. POKROVSKY (Deputy Chief Prosecutor for
the U.S.S.R.): I would like permission to ask this witness several
questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness</span>]: Tell us, witness, do you know what
was the particular purpose of the concentration camp at Dachau;
was it really, so to speak, a concentration camp of extermination?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Until the year 1943 it was really an extermination
camp. After 1943 a good many factories and munition plants were
established, also inside the camp, particularly after the bombardments
started, and then it became more of a work camp. But as
far as the results are concerned there was no difference, because
the prisoners had to work so hard while going hungry that they
died from hunger and exhaustion instead of from beatings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: Must I understand you this way, that, in
fact, both before 1943 and after 1943 Dachau was a camp of extermination
and that there were different ways of extermination?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: That is so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: How many, according to your own
observations, went through this camp of extermination, Dachau;
how many internees came originally from the U.S.S.R., how many
passed through the camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I cannot state that exactly, only approximately. First,
after November 1941, there were exclusively Russian prisoners of
war in uniform. They had separate camps and were liquidated
within a few months. In the summer of 1942, those who remained
of these—I believe there were 12,000 prisoners of war—were
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
transported to Mauthausen; and, as I learned from the people who
came from Mauthausen to Dachau, they were liquidated in gas
chambers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, after the Russian prisoners of war, Russian children were
brought to Dachau. There were, I believe, 2,000 boys, 6 to 17 years
old. They were kept in one or two special blocks. They were
assigned to particularly brutal people, the “greens,” who beat them
at every step. These young boys also.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: What do you mean when you refer to the
“greens”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Those were the so-called professional criminals. They
beat these young boys and gave them the hardest work. They
worked particularly in the plantations where they had to pull
ploughs, sowing machines, and street rollers instead of horses and
motors being used. Also in all transport Kommandos Russian
children were used exclusively. At least 70 percent of them died
of tuberculosis, I believe, and those who remained were then sent
to a special camp in the Tyrol in 1943 or the beginning of 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then after the children, several thousand so-called Eastern
Workers were killed. These were civilians who were removed from
the Eastern territories to Germany and then because of so-called
work-sabotage were put into concentration camps. In addition
there were many Russian officers and intellectuals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: I would like to ask you to be more exact
in your answers in regard to those people whom you call “greens.”
Did I correctly understand you when you said that those criminals
had the task of supervising those internees arriving at the camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: And these professional criminals were
given complete charge of the children, and they beat and ill-treated
these children of Soviet citizens and put them to work far beyond
their strength, so that they became tubercular?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: What do you know about the executions of
the citizens of the U.S.S.R. which were carried out in this camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I believe I am not far from the truth when I say that
of all those executed, at least 75 percent were Russians, and that
women as well as men were brought to Dachau from outside to be
executed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: Can you give us more details in regard to
the execution of 94 high field and staff officers of the Red Army,
which you already spoke about in reply to the question of my
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
colleague? Who were these officers, and what rank did they hold?
What were the reasons for their execution? Do you know anything
at all about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: In the summer or late spring of 1944 high-ranking
Russian officers—generals, colonels, and majors—were sent to
Dachau. During the following weeks they were examined by the
political department; that is to say, after each interrogation they
were brought to the camp hospital in a completely battered condition.
I myself saw and knew well some who for weeks had to lie on
their bellies, and we had to remove by surgical operation parts of
their skin and muscles which had become mortified. Many succumbed
to these methods of investigation. The others, 94 people in
number, were then brought to the crematory in the beginning of
September 1944 on orders from the RSHA in Berlin and there,
while on their knees, shot through the neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition, in the winter and spring of 1945 several Russian
officers were brought from solitary confinement to the crematory
and there either hanged or shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: I would like to ask you the same kind of
question about the execution of the 40 Russian students. It is
possible for you to give us a few details about the execution?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes, those Russian students and intellectuals—I can
recall that a doctor was also among them—were brought from the
Moosburg Camp to Dachau, and after 1 month they were all executed.
That was in March of 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: Do you happen to know what the reason
was for their execution?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: The order for it came from Berlin. We did not get to
know the reason, because I saw the bodies only after the execution
and the reason was read aloud before the execution took place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: This execution produced the impression
that it was one of the stages of the general plan for extermination
of the people who entered Dachau?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes. It was easy to see that these executions, these
transports of invalids, and the way epidemics were dealt with,
were all part of the general plan for extermination; and particularly,
and this I must emphasize, it was the Russian prisoners who
were always treated the worst of all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: Would you be so kind as to say what is
known to you in regard to those internees who were in the “Nacht
und Nebel” (night and fog) category? Were there many of these
internees? Do you know the reason why they were sent to the
concentration camp?
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Many so-called Nacht und Nebel prisoners came to the
concentration camp. The people so designated were mostly from
the western countries of Europe, particularly Frenchmen, Belgians,
and Dutchmen. The Russian people—and this was also the case with
the Czechs and also in my own case—frequently had the designation
“return undesirable.” This actually meant the same. Shortly before
the liberation many of these people were executed on the order of
the camp commander, that is, shot in front of the crematory. Many
of these people, particularly the French and Russians, were serious
cases of typhus and with a temperature of 40 degrees were carried
on stretchers to the rifle range.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: It seems to me that you mentioned something
about a considerable number of prisoners who died of
starvation. Could you tell me how large that number was—the
number of people who died of starvation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I believe that two-thirds of the entire population of
the camp suffered from severe malnutrition and that at least
25 percent of the dead had literally died of starvation. It was called
in German “Hungertyphus.” Apart from that, tuberculosis was the
most widespread disease in the camp and it spread also because of
malnutrition. Most of its victims were Russians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: It seems to me that you said, answering the
question of my colleague, that the majority of those who died of
starvation and exhaustion were French, Russians, and Italians. How
do you account for the fact that in just these categories of internees
more people died than in other categories?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: How do you explain that especially Russians,
French, and Italians made up the largest number of those people
who died from starvation? Was there any difference in the feeding
of internees of the different nationalities, or was there some other
reason?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: It was like this: The others, the Germans, Poles, and
Czechs, who had already been in the camp for some time, had had
time, if I may say so, to adjust themselves to camp conditions,
physically I mean. The Russian deteriorated rapidly. The same
was true of the French and the Italians. Moreover, these nationals
for the most part arrived from other camps suffering from malnutrition
so that they then soon fell easy prey to the other epidemics
and diseases. Also, the Germans, Poles, and many others who
worked in the armaments industry had since the year 1943 been
able to get parcels from home. That, of course, was not the case
with citizens of Soviet Russia, France, or Italy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: Can you answer the question about what
Rosenberg, Kaltenbrunner, Sauckel, or Funk saw when they were in
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
the Dachau Concentration Camp? Do you know what they saw and
what was shown them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I had no opportunity of seeing what happened during
these visits. Only on very rare occasions did one have the opportunity
of seeing these visitors from the window and observing
where they went. I seldom had the opportunity to be present as
I was in the case of Himmler’s visits and those of Obergruppenführer
Pohl and once on the occasion of Gauleiter Giesler’s visit,
when they were shown the experiments or the patients in the
hospital. As to the others I do not know what they individually
saw and did in the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: Perhaps you had an opportunity of observing
the length of the visit of those people in the camp, whether
the visit was short—just for a few moments—or whether they
stayed there a long time. I have in mind Rosenberg, Kaltenbrunner,
Sauckel, and Funk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: That varied. Many visitors were there for half an
hour, many, as I said before, spent as many as 3 hours there. We
were always able to observe that quite well because at those times
no work could be done, nor was food distributed. We did not
carry on our work in the hospital and had to wait until the signal
was given to us that the visitors had left the camp. Apart from
that I had no means of knowing how long these visits in the camp
lasted in the individual cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: Can you recall the visit of Kaltenbrunner,
Rosenberg, Funk, and Sauckel? On the basis of what you said
just now could you state whether they were brief visits or whether
those people stayed there for several hours? Did you understand
my question or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Unfortunately, I cannot make a statement on that
because, as I said, the visits took place so frequently that I have
difficulty, after all these years, in recalling whether they lasted for
a short or longer time. Many visits, for instance, from schools—from
the military and police schools—lasted a whole day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. POKROVSKY: Thank you. I have no further questions of
this witness at this stage of the sitting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. CHARLES DUBOST (Deputy Chief Prosecutor for the French
Republic): You alluded to a convoy of deported French people who
came from Compiègne, of whom only 1,200 survivors arrived. Were
there any other convoys?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes. There were transports, particularly from Bordeaux,
Lyon, and Compiègne, all in the first half of 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were all the transports carried out under the same
conditions?
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: The conditions under which these transports were made
were, if not the same, at any rate very similar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Each time you were able to see on arrival that
there were numerous victims?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What were the causes of death?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: The deaths were caused by the fact that too many
people were packed into the cars, which were then locked, and that
they did not get anything to eat or drink for several days. Usually
they starved or suffocated. Many of those who survived were
brought to the camp hospital, and of these a large number died
from various complications and diseases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did you make autopsies on the people who died
while en route?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes, particularly for the transport from Compiègne my
services were demanded because the rumor was spread that the
French Maquis and Fascists had attacked and killed each other in
the cars. I had to inspect these corpses, but in no case did I find
any signs of violence. Moreover, I took 10 corpses as a test, dissected
them thoroughly and sent special reports on them to Berlin. All
these people had died of suffocation. I was also able to note during
the autopsy that these were prominent people of France. I could
tell from their identity papers and uniforms that they were high-ranking
French officers, priests, deputies, and well-nourished people
who had been taken direct from civilian life to the cars and sent
to Dachau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: After the reports which you sent to Berlin did the
conditions under which the transports were made remain the same?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Nothing happened, as usual. Always long reports were
written but conditions did not improve at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You indicated that some French generals had been
put to death shortly before the liberation of the camp. Do you
know the names of these generals?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Unfortunately I have forgotten these names. I can
remember only what I was told by the prisoners who were kept
in the bunkers with them—that they were the prominent personalities
from Germany and other countries: Pastor Niemöller was
there, also a French prince, Schuschnigg was there too, and members
of the French Government and many others. I was told that one
of the generals who had been shot was a close relative of General
De Gaulle. Unfortunately I have forgotten his name.
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: If I understood you correctly, these generals were
prisoners of war who had been transported to this concentration
camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: These two generals were not in the concentration
camp. They were kept, along with the other prominent personalities,
in the so-called “Kommandantur-Arrest,” that is, in the bunker
separated from the camp. On various occasions when they needed
medical attention I came into contact with them, but that was very
seldom. Otherwise they did not come into contact with the other
prisoners at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did they belong to the category of deported
people whose “return was undesirable” or were they in the Nacht
und Nebel category?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I do not know. It was 2 days previously that all the
others who were kept in the bunker were sent by special transport
to the Tyrol. That was, I believe, a week or 8 days before the
liberation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You indicated that numerous visitors, German
military men, students, political men, often toured the camp. Can
you say if any ordinary people, like workers or farmers, knew
what was going on in this camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: In my opinion, the people who lived in the neighborhood
of Munich must have known of all these things, because the
prisoners went every day to various factories in Munich and the
neighborhood; and at work they frequently came into contact with
the civilian workers. Moreover, the various suppliers and consumers
often entered the fields and the factories of the German
armament works and they saw what was done to the prisoners and
what they looked like.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Can you say in what way the French were treated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Well, if I said that the Russians were treated worst of
all, the French were the second in order. Of course, there were
differences in the treatment of individual persons. The Nacht und
Nebel prisoners were treated quite differently; likewise the
prominent political personalities and the intellectuals. That was so
for all nationalities. And the workers and peasants also were
treated differently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: If I understood correctly, the treatment reserved
for the French intellectuals was particularly rigorous. Do you
remember the treatment inflicted on some French intellectuals and
can you tell us their names?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I had many comrades among the physicians and
university professors who worked with me in the hospital. Unfortunately
a large number of them died of typhus. Most of the
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
French, in fact, died of typhus. I remember best of all Professor
Limousin. He arrived in very poor condition with the transport
from Compiègne. I took him into my department as assistant
pathologist. Then I also knew the Bishop of Clermont-Ferrand.
There were other physicians and university professors whom I
knew. I remember Professor Roche, Dr. Lemartin, and many others—I
have forgotten their names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: In the course of the conversations which you had
with Dr. Rascher were you informed of the purpose of these
experiments?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I didn’t understand the question, excuse me please.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were you informed of the purpose of the medical
and biological experiments made by Dr. Rascher in the camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Well, Dr. Rascher made exclusively so-called Air Force
experiments in the camp. He was a major in the Air Force and
was assigned to investigate the conditions to which parachutists
were subjected and, secondly, the conditions of those people who
had to make an emergency landing on the sea or had fallen into
the sea. According to scientific standards, insofar as I can judge,
this was all to no purpose. Like all the other experiments, it was
simply useless murder; and it is amazing that learned university
professors and physicians, particularly, were capable of carrying
out these experiments according to plan. These experiments were
much worse than all the liquidations and executions, because all
the victims of these experiments simply had their suffering prolonged,
as various medicines such as vitamins, hormones, tonics,
and injections, which were not available for the ordinary patients,
were provided for these patients so that the experiments might
last longer and give those people more time to observe their
victims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I am speaking now of the experiments of Dr.
Rascher only. Had he received the order to make these experiments
or did he make them on his own initiative?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: These experiments were made on Himmler’s direct
orders; also, Dr. Rascher had close relations with Himmler and was
like a relative of his. He visited Himmler very often and Himmler
visited Dr. Rascher several times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Have you any information as to the kind of physicians
who were making these experiments? Were they always SS
men or were they members of medical faculties of universities who,
however, did not belong to the SS?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: That varied. For example, the malaria station was
under the direction of Professor Klaus Schilling of the Koch
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
Institute in Berlin. The Phlegmone station also had several
university professors. The surgical station was manned solely by
SS doctors. In the Air Force station there were exclusively SS and
military doctors. It differed. Dr. Bleibeck from Vienna conducted
the experiments with sea water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were the experiments for the Luftwaffe made on
the order of Himmler only?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Himmler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Do you know—this is the last question—how
many Frenchmen passed through this camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I believe at least eight or ten thousand people arrived
at the camp. Furthermore, I know very well that, particularly
during the last period, several thousand French prisoners marched
on foot from the western camps, especially from Natzweiler, Struthof,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span>, and that only very small remnants of these ever
reached Dachau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Can you tell us to what branches of the
German service those who were employed at the camp belonged?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: If I understood you correctly, the highest authority on
everything going on in the camp was the so-called Security Main
Office in Berlin. All demands and directives came from Berlin;
also the experimental stations received a definite quota of subjects
for the experiments and the numbers were fixed by Berlin. If the
doctors making the experiments needed a larger number, new
requests had to be sent to Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but what I want to know is to what
branch of the service the men belonged who were employed in the
camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: They were all SS men and most of them from the SD.
During the last days, at the very end, a few members of the Armed
Forces were there as guards but the men in charge were entirely
SS men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Were there any of the Gestapo there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes, that was the so-called political department, which
was directed by the chief of the Munich Gestapo. It had control of
all the interrogations and regulations, and it proposed the executions,
transports, and transports of invalids. Also, all the people who were
provided for the experiments had to be approved by the political
department.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any of the defendants’ counsel want to
cross-examine the witness?
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Witness, you told us that at one time the Defendant
Funk also was at Dachau, and you informed us, if I understood
you correctly, that this happened on the occasion of some celebration
or state conference between the Axis Powers. Please think back a little
and tell us when that was approximately. Perhaps—just a moment—perhaps
you could tell us the year, maybe also the season, and
perhaps you could also state which political celebration it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: As far as Funk is concerned, I can remember that it
was, I believe, a conference of finance ministers. The papers had
announced that it would take place and we were informed beforehand
that some of the ministers would come to Dachau. Such a visit was
actually made a few days afterwards, and it was said that Minister
Funk was among the visitors. It was, I believe, during the first half
of the year 1944. I cannot say that with absolute certainty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: You mean to say: during the first half of 1944, on
the occasion of a conference of finance ministers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Where did that conference take place?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: If I remember correctly—I didn’t write that down, of
course—that was either in Salzburg or Reichenhall or Berchtesgaden,
somewhere in the neighborhood of Munich, I believe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: From whom did you learn at that time that on
the next day, or the day after, high-ranking visitors would arrive?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: We always received an order to prepare for such a
visit. Elaborate preparations were always made; everything was
cleaned up; everything had to be in order, as you will understand;
and those people whose presence might be undesirable or those who,
in a certain sense, might be dangerous, had to disappear. Thus,
whenever such high-ranking visitors were announced we always
received an order from the camp headquarters 1 or 2 days beforehand;
and, also these visitors were always accompanied by the
camp commander.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: By the camp commander? Now, if you know that
the Defendant Funk was there and people talked about it, then I
think they would have mentioned also what other persons were
present at this visit made by the Defendant Funk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I cannot remember. There were always several important
persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: The rest do not interest me. I am interested only
in knowing whether or not at that particular visit, which was said
to have been made by Funk, word was passed around the camp
that such and such personalities were with him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I cannot remember that now.
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: You cannot remember. Can you remember afterwards,
perhaps on the next day or the day after, something was
said perhaps by people who had seen the visitors?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes, we always discussed that, but now I can no longer
remember which personalities were mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Witness, I am not interested in any other visit,
but in this specific visit, as long as I do not say anything to the
contrary. In this case I should like to know whether or not anything
at all was said later on about the persons who were there with
Funk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: That I do not know; there were so many visits. For
instance, after one visit, the very next day already another visit
would be announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Now, you do also remember the visit that Funk
made. Well, if other finance ministers were there, one would think
that you would recall these other persons also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I cannot remember that. It may be that the people with
whom I talked did not know who these other persons were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Do you know why, or to put it differently, which
departments of the camp were visited on the occasion when Funk
was supposed to have made this visit. At any rate he did not come
to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: No; he did not come to the pathological department.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: He did not. But you were also prepared?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes. All departments had always to be prepared, even
if no visitors came. It also happened at times that a visit was
announced, and then, for one reason or another, nothing came of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Witness, as regards these observations of yours
that you have related to us today, have you been interrogated in
regard to them many times already?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I was interrogated on these matters for the first time
before the military court at Dachau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Did you also at that time say that Funk had
been there? I repeat, did you before the military court at Dachau
say anything to the effect that Funk had been present?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes, I said the same thing before the court at Dachau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: About Funk?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Also about Funk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: But is it true, Witness? I ask again whether it is
really true, because you are here as a witness under oath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: You were interrogated also the day before yesterday?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Did you, at that time, also make these statements
about Funk?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I said the same thing at the interrogation conducted
by the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Is that also in the record which I believe you
signed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I signed no record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: You signed no record?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: No; I simply signed what was read by the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Well, that is a record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes, but in that record there is no mention of these
visits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Why then didn’t you mention these visits the day
before yesterday?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I was asked about it orally, and the prosecutor told
me that these matters would be taken up orally in the courtroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Were you then also told where the defendants
sit in the courtroom?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: No. Before the military court I was shown all the
pictures.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Aha!</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: And I was asked to identify to the court the various
people. I identified the three of whom I said today that I had seen
them in person. Funk and others I did not name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: You did not name Funk?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I did not say that I had personally seen him or that
I could identify him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: But when the pictures were shown to you did
you see the defendants in the pictures?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Now, if I understand you correctly, you knew
today where, for instance, Funk or Frick or anyone else was sitting?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Funk I do not know personally, because I did not
see him at that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Were you not told when the pictures were shown
to you at Dachau, “This is Funk; look at him; do you know him”?
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: No; that was done quite differently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: How?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: All the pictures were shown to me and I was asked
to say which of these individuals I had seen at the Dachau camp.
Of these people I named these three. There was no further discussion
whatsoever in regard to the other pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Well, Dr. Blaha, when your hearing started and
you were questioned by the President or by the prosecutor, you
made a statement, I believe, in the Czech language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: What then?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: In the German language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: No; everyone heard that that was not German,
but it was obviously Czech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: The first sentence only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: The first sentences? Well, now, as it will in any
case come into the court transcript for practical purposes, I ask you
to state and to repeat quite literally, giving the true sense, that
which you said then, because we are interested in that from the
point of view of the Defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I believe that it was included in the transcript because
an English translation was added to my statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: No, I do not believe that Czech is being translated.
But anyhow please repeat it. We did not hear it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes. I said that I was ready, since it is technically
impossible to use my native Czech tongue in the hearing, to give
my testimony in German, because I have lived in German surroundings
through all these events which occurred during the last 7 years
and which are now the subject of this Trial. Moreover, the special
and new expressions referring to life in the camp can be found
only in German, and in no other dictionary can one find such
suitable and expressive terms as in the German language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Then, Mr. President, I have no further questions.
Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Witness, were the inmates of the Concentration
Camp Dachau bound to secrecy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: No. Of course, if someone was discharged from the
camp by the Gestapo—those cases were few and far between,
particularly in the case of the Germans, who were then drafted—one
had to sign a so-called pledge of secrecy.
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Could the inmates of the camp, those inside the
camp, who worked on farms, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, talk to the other workers
about conditions in the camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes, there were opportunities, because the people
worked in the same rooms and factories with other workers—civilian
workers. That was the case in the German armament industry, in
the fields, and in all factories in Munich and the surroundings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: If I understood you correctly, you said previously
that visitors, people who delivered things, and customers, also had
an opportunity of observing these conditions in the camp without
difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes. Many of these people had access everywhere, in the
fields as well as in the various factories, and could observe what life
was like in these places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: And what did they see there in the way of
atrocities and ill-treatment, and so forth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I believe they saw how the people worked, what they
looked like and what was produced there. For instance, I can
remember one example of what they saw quite well. At that time
I was working in the fields. We were pulling a heavy street roller,
16 men, and a group of girls passed who were on an excursion.
When they passed, their leader said very loudly, so that we all could
hear it, “Look, those people are so lazy that rather than harness
up a team of horses they pull it themselves.” That was supposed to be
a joke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Witness, when did you first have occasion, after
your liberation from the concentration camp, to tell outside people
about those horrible atrocities which you related to us today?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I did not understand that; please repeat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: When did you first have an opportunity, after
your discharge or liberation from the concentration camp, of telling
an outsider about these horrible atrocities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Immediately after the liberation. I was at that time,
as chief physician of the concentration camp, interrogated by the
American investigating corps; and it was to this corps that I told
this story for the first time, and I also gave them various proofs—diagrams,
and the medical records which I had saved from being
burnt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: That prosecutor believed the information you gave
without further ado?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Witness, you said that the Defendant Rosenberg
was pointed out to you in the Concentration Camp Dachau shortly
after you arrived there.
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: When was that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: In the year 1941; first half of 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: First half?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I believe so, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Can you perhaps remember the month?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I cannot remember. I arrived in April; I believe it
was between April and July or something like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: From April to July 1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I believe so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Was Rosenberg at that time in uniform?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: He was in uniform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: In what uniform?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I believe it was an SS uniform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: SS uniform?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: It was a—I cannot say that very precisely—but he was
in uniform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: All right, you remember <span class='it'>prima facie</span> that it was
an SS uniform, that is, a black uniform?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: No, at that time the SS no longer wore the black
uniform, because after the beginning of the war they wore field
uniforms and other similar uniforms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Then, you assume it was a gray uniform?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Something like that; whether it was gray or yellow or
brown I don’t remember any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: That is just the point: whether it was gray, brown,
or yellow. Was it a field uniform?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I do not know because from 1939 I was in the concentration
camp, and I am not at all familiar with the various German
uniforms, ranks, and branches of the Army, and so forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: But you just said that during the war they changed
the uniform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes, the men in the Gestapo also changed theirs. When
I was arrested in 1939, all Gestapo personnel wore this black
uniform. Then, after the war broke out most of them wore either
green or gray uniforms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: May I ask you again: Did Rosenberg wear a wartime
uniform or a peacetime uniform?
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I believe it was a wartime uniform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Wartime uniform? The Defendant Rosenberg was
pointed out to you by another comrade, wasn’t he?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: At what distance?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Well, he was just going down the camp street. That
was perhaps 30 or 40 degrees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Thirty or forty metres you mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Well, 30 metres; 30 paces I wanted to say, 30 or 40 paces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: And had you previously seen photographs of
Rosenberg? Did you already have an idea of what Rosenberg
looked like?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: And when this comrade showed you Rosenberg,
was it then necessary for him to say, “This is Rosenberg”? Didn’t
you recognize him already from having seen him in the photographs
which you had previously.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I cannot remember that. But when he showed him to
me I remembered that I knew him already from the various
pictures in the newspapers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: May I ask you to describe the incident precisely?
How it happened; where you were standing; where Rosenberg came
from; and who was in his company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Who was in his company? I knew only the camp
commander.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Who was the camp commander at that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Pierkowski was camp commander, Sturmbannführer
Pierkowski.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Do you know whether he is still alive?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: No, I don’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: The camp commander?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Pierkowski. Then the Lagerführer Ziel and Hoffmann,
I knew them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Now were you in your room and looking out of
the window?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: No, we were in one of the so-called “block” streets.
This led into another street along which the visitors passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: And what was said to you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: “Look, there goes Rosenberg.”
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Was Rosenberg alone?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: No, he was with the other persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: That is to say, only with the camp commander?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: No, there were many other people with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: That is to say, he had an escort, a staff?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Members of Rosenberg’s staff?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I don’t know whether that was Rosenberg’s staff, but
there were a number of persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: A number of persons? Witness, the Defendant
Rosenberg assures me most definitely that he has never been to the
concentration camp at Dachau. Is it possible that there has been
a mistake?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I believe I am not mistaken. Besides the German in
question knew Rosenberg very well, I believe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: How do you know that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Because he told me so definitely. Otherwise, I have
no way of knowing that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Thoma.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You will forgive me if I point out to you
that this is intended to be an expeditious trial and that it is not
right to take up too much time upon small points like this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: My Lord, I ask your permission to remark that
the question of whether or not Rosenberg was in the concentration
camp is of decisive importance. I thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. OTTO PANNENBECKER (Counsel for Defendant Frick): The
Defendant Frick states that he has never been in Dachau Camp.
Therefore, in order to clarify the facts I should like to ask the
following questions:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, at what distance do you believe you saw Frick?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I saw him from the window as he passed with a
number of people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Did you know Frick before?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes, from pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: From pictures? Did you recognize him
yourself or did some friend tell you that it was Frick?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: A number of us saw him and I looked at him particularly,
because at that time he was already Protector of Bohemia
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
and Moravia. For that reason I had a personal interest in
recognizing him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Did Frick wear a uniform?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I do not believe so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Did you recognize anybody who was
with him, anyone from his staff or from the camp command?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I did not know his staff. From the camp command
there was Camp Commander Weiter. Camp Commander Weiter,
and his adjutant, Otto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Could you name anyone of your comrades
who also recognized him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: There were many comrades of mine who at that time
were standing at the window. Unfortunately, I cannot say who
they were, because, as you will understand, life in the concentration
camp was so full of incidents that one could not record these things
accurately in one’s memory. One remembers only the more
important events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Did you recognize him at once of your
own accord when he passed by, or had it been mentioned previously
that Frick was expected?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: No, it was not mentioned then. We simply heard that
a high-ranking visitor was expected, and we were waiting for this
high-ranking visitor. We were not told beforehand who it would be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Did you recognize Frick immediately
when you came into the courtroom, or did you know beforehand
that he was sitting in the fourth seat here?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: No, I recognized him easily, because I have already
seen him many times in various pictures, and because he is a well-known
person in Bohemia and Moravia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: You believe then that there can be no
question of any error.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I don’t think so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: May I then ask the Court whether Frick
himself may take the stand to testify that he has never seen Dachau
Camp? I want to make this motion now so that, if necessary, the
witness might be confronted with Frick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Counsel for the defendants will understand
that they will have the opportunity, when it comes to their time
to present their cases, to call all the defendants, but they will not
have an opportunity of calling them now. They will have to wait
until the case for the Prosecution is over and they will then have
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
an opportunity, each of them, to call the defendant for whom they
appear, if they wish to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: I simply thought, that as the witness is
available now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Dr. Kubuschok approached the lectern.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is now 5:00 o’clock and unless you are
going to be very short .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are you going to be very short?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EGON KUBUSCHOK (Counsel for the Reich Cabinet):
Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Witness, you said that when prominent
visitors came to the camp, for instance, Reich ministers, extensive
preparations were made beforehand. You also said that undesirable
persons were removed. Maybe you could supplement that statement.
I am interested to know what the purpose of these preparations
was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I meant that everything had to be in order. In our
infirmary all the patients had to lie in bed quietly, everything was
washed and prepared; the instruments were polished, as is usually
the case for high-ranking visitors. We were not allowed to do
anything—no operations; no bandages nor food were given out
before the visit had terminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Could you perhaps tell me which undesirable
persons were to be removed, as you said before?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Well, the Russians especially were always kept strictly
in their blocks. It was said that they were afraid of possible
demonstrations, assassinations, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Were prisoners kept out of sight because
they showed outward signs of ill-treatment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: It goes without saying that before the visitors nobody
was struck, beaten, hanged, or executed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: To sum up, the purpose of these preparations
was to prevent the guests from seeing the concentration camp
as it really was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: From seeing the cruelties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Court will not sit in open session tomorrow,
Saturday, and will only sit in the morning on Monday, because
there is work to be done in the closed session tomorrow and on
Monday afternoon. I thought it would be convenient for counsel
to know that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Court will now adjourn.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 14 January 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<div><span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span><h1>THIRTY-THIRD DAY<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>Monday, 14 January 1946</span></h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would you have the witness brought in?
I think one of the defendants’ counsel was about to cross-examine
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness, Blaha, took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR LUDWIG BABEL (Counsel for the SS and SD): I would
like to put to the witness a few practical questions which I think
necessary both for a better understanding of the earlier testimony
of the witness and for my own information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The witness was in the concentration camp from 1941 to 1945 and
should be well informed on conditions as they were. His memory,
as is evident from his previous statements, seems to be excellent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you know how the proportion of political and criminal inmates
changed during the various periods? What were the approximate
figures of political and criminal inmates in Dachau?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: In Dachau it varied. There were political prisoners,
professional criminals, and the so-called black or asocial elements.
I am, of course, speaking only of the German prisoners; the inmates
of other nations were all political prisoners. Only the German
inmates were divided into red, green, and black prisoners. The great
majority of Germans were political prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Can you indicate the approximate proportion?
A quarter, a half, or three-quarters?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I am sorry, I didn’t hear you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Can you give figures? How many were political
prisoners—half, three-quarters, or how many? Can you give an
approximate number?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I would say that of 5,000 German prisoners, 3,000 were
political and 2,000 were green and black prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Was that the proportion during the whole 4-&nbsp;or 5-year
period?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: It changed; because many died, some Germans left,
many were drafted, and there were many new arrivals. In the last
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
years there were more and more political prisoners, because many
of the green prisoners were drafted to the front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: What approximately was the total number in
1941, 1943, and 1945?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Do you mean the total number of prisoners?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Yes, the total number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: We had 8,000 to 9,000 in 1941; in 1943 there were 15,000 to
20,000; and between the end of 1944 and the beginning of 1945 we
had more than 70,000 or 80,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Another question: You mentioned that at first
you worked in the plantations. What did you mean by plantations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: The plantations were a large estate of the SS, in which
spices, medical herbs, and things of that sort were raised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Was this plantation inside the camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: No, it was in the near vicinity of the camp, not a part
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: You also mentioned work in armament factories.
I gathered from your testimony that these armament factories were
partially within and partially outside the camp. Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes, at first these so-called German armament works
were only outside the camp. Then, as a result of the bombings, some
sections were moved into the interior of the concentration camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: What was the number of camp guards in 1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: For actual guard duty usually three SS companies were
in the camp, but at Dachau there were in addition a large garrison of
SS and a Kommandantur. Guards were taken from other SS formations
from time to time, when it was necessary. It varied and
depended on how many guards were needed. For regular duty
there were usually three companies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Were the prisoners in the armament factories
guarded during working hours?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes. Every labor detachment had a commander selected
from the guard companies and, in addition, these so-called guards,
who went with the detachment to their place of work and then
brought the prisoners back to the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: While you were at the camp, did you witness any
ill-treatment on the part of these guards in the course of their daily
activities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes; a great deal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Often?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: For what reasons?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: The reasons varied, depending on the nature of the
guards or the commanders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: But you said you were occupied, indeed according
to your statements, very much occupied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: How then did you have an opportunity of
observing such ill-treatment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: I performed many autopsies on people either shot or
beaten to death at their work, and made official reports on the cause
of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: You said they were shot. Did you see such
incidents yourself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Then, how do you know that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BLAHA: The bodies were brought to me from the place of work,
and it was my duty to ascertain the cause of death; that the men
had been beaten to death, for example, that the skull or ribs had
been fractured, that the man had died of internal hemorrhage, or that
he had been shot; I had to make an official report on the cause of
death. Sometimes, but this was rare, when an investigation was
conducted, I was called in as witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Dodd, do you wish to re-examine the
witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I have no further questions to ask the witness at
this time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any other member of the prosecuting
staff want to re-examine? Colonel Pokrovsky?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COLONEL POKROVSKY: At this stage of the Trial I have no
further questions to ask the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the witness can go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness left the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I should like to ask the Tribunal at this time to take
judicial notice of the findings and the sentences imposed by the
Military Court at Dachau, Germany, on the 13th day of December
1945. The findings were dated the 12th and the sentences on the
13th. I have here a certified copy of the findings and the sentences,
Document Number 3590-PS, which I should like to offer as Exhibit
Number USA-664.
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have copies of this been given to the
defendants?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Yes. They have been sent to the defendants’
counsel information room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I have one other matter that I should like to take
up very briefly before the Tribunal this morning. It is concerned
with a matter that arose after I had left the courtroom to return to
the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 13th of December we offered in evidence Document
Number 3421-PS, and Exhibit Numbers USA-252 and 254. They were,
respectively, the Court will recall, sections of human
skin taken from human bodies and preserved; and a human
head, the head of a human being, which had been preserved.
On the 14th day of December, according to the Record, counsel
for the Defendant Kaltenbrunner addressed the Tribunal
and complained that the affidavit, which was offered, of one
Pfaffenberger, failed to state that the camp commandant at Buchenwald,
one Koch, along with his wife, was condemned to death for
having committed precisely these atrocities, this business of tanning
the skin and preserving the head. And in the course of
the discussion before the Tribunal the Record reveals that counsel for
the Defendant Bormann, in addressing the Tribunal, stated that it
was highly probable that the Prosecution knew that the German
authorities had objected to this camp commandant Koch and, in fact,
knew that he had been tried and sentenced for doing precisely these
things. And there was some intimation, we feel, that the Prosecution,
having this knowledge, withheld it from the Tribunal. Now,
I wish to say that we had no knowledge at all about this man Koch
at the time that we offered the proof; didn’t know anything about
him except that he had been the commandant, according to the
affidavit. But, subsequent to this objection we had an investigation
made, and we have found that he was tried in 1944, indeed, by an SS
court, but not for having tanned human skin nor having preserved
a human head but for having embezzled some money, for what—as
the judge who tried him tells us—was a charge of general corruption
and for having murdered someone with whom he had some personal
difficulties. Indeed, the judge, a Dr. Morgen, tells us that he saw the
tattooed human skin and he saw a human head in Commandant
Koch’s office and that he saw a lampshade there made out of
human skin. But there were no charges at the time that he was
tried for having done these things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would also point out to the Tribunal that, we say, the testimony
of Dr. Blaha sheds further light on whether or not these exhibits,
Numbers USA-252 and 254, were isolated instances of that atrocious
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
kind of conduct. We have not been able to locate the affiant. We
have made an effort to do so, but we have not been able to locate
him thus far.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Locate whom?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: The affiant Pfaffenberger, the one whose affidavit
was offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, Mr. Dodd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KURT KAUFFMANN (Counsel for Defendant Kaltenbrunner):
The statement just made is undoubtedly significant, but it
would be of importance to have the documents which served to
convict the commandant and his wife at the time. Kaltenbrunner
told me that it was known in the whole SS that the commandant
Koch and his wife had been taken to account also—I emphasize
“also”—on account of these things and that it was known in the SS
that one of the factors determining the severity of the sentences
imposed had been this proved inhuman behavior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. As you were the counsel who
made the allegation that the commandant Koch had been put to
death for his inhuman treatment, it would seem that you are the
party to produce the judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: I never had the verdict in my hand. I
depended on the information which Kaltenbrunner gave me personally
and orally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It was you who made the assertion. I don’t
care where you got it from. You made the assertion; therefore it
is for you to produce the document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COLONEL H. J. PHILLIMORE: (Junior Counsel for the United
Kingdom): May it please the Tribunal: Briefs and document books
have been handed in. The documents in the document book are in
the order in which I shall refer to them, and the references to them
in the briefs are also in that order. On the first page of the brief
is set out the extract from Appendix A of the Indictment, which
deals with the criminality of this defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you dealing first of all with Raeder or
with Dönitz?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: With Dönitz. My learned friend, Major
Elwyn Jones, will deal with Raeder immediately after. Reading at
Page 1 of the brief.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, may I proceed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Briefs and document books have been
handed in. The documents are in the document book in the order
in which I shall refer to them, and the references in the brief to the
documents are in that same order. On the first page of the brief is
set out the extract from the Indictment as Appendix A, which deals
with the allegations against this defendant. It sets out the positions
he held and charges him, first, with promoting the preparations for
war, set forth in Count One; second, with participating in the military
planning and preparation for wars of aggression and wars in
violation of international treaties, agreements, and assurances, set
forth in Count One and Two of the Indictment; and thirdly, with
authorizing, directing, and participating in the War Crimes set forth
in Count Three of the Indictment, including particularly the crimes
against persons and property on the High Seas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, if at any place I appear to trespass on Count Three, it is
with the consent and courtesy of the Chief Prosecutor for the French
Republic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, on the second page of the brief are set out first the
positions held by the Defendant Dönitz; and the document in
question is the first document in the document book, 2887-PS, which
has already been put in as Exhibit Number USA-12. The Tribunal
will see that after his appointment in 1935 as Commander of the
Weddigen U-boat Flotilla—that was, in fact, the first flotilla to be
formed after the end of the World War in 1918—the defendant, who
was in effect then Commander of U-boats, rose steadily in rank as
the U-boat arm expanded, until he became an admiral. And then
on the 30th of January 1943, he was appointed Grossadmiral and
succeeded the Defendant Raeder as Commander-in-Chief of the
German Navy, retaining his command of the U-boat arm. Then on
the 1st of May 1945, he succeeded Hitler as head of Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, as appears from a number of documents which I shall
put in evidence, the defendant was awarded the following decorations:
On the 18th of September 1939 the Cluster of the Iron Cross,
first class, for the U-boat successes in the Baltic during the Polish
campaign. This award was followed on the 21st of April 1940 by the
high award of the Knight’s Cross to the Iron Cross, while on the
7th of April 1943 he received personally from Hitler the Oak Leaf
to the Knight’s Cross of the Iron Cross, as the 223rd recipient, for
his services in building up the German Navy and, in particular, his
services for the offensive U-boat arm for the coming war, which
were outstanding. And now I put in the next document in the document
book, D-436, which becomes Exhibit GB-183. That is an extract
from the official publication <span class='it'>Das Archiv</span> on the defendant’s promotion
to vice admiral. It is dated the 27th of September 1940, and I
read the last two sentences:
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In 4 years of untiring and, in the fullest sense of the word,
uninterrupted work of training, he succeeds in developing the
young U-boat armed personnel and material till it is a weapon
of a striking power unexpected even by the experts. More
than 3 million gross tons of enemy shipping sunk in only 1
year, achieved with only a few boats, speak better than words
of the merits of this man.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next document in the document book, 1463-PS, which I put in
as Exhibit GB-184, is an extract from the diary for the German
Navy, 1944 edition, and it serves to emphasize the contents of that
last document. My Lord, I won’t read from it. The relevant passage
is on Page 2, and if I might summarize that, it describes in detail the
defendant’s work in building up the U-boat arm, his ceaseless work
in training night and day to close the gap of 17 years during which
no training had taken place, his responsibility for new improvements,
and for devising the “pack” tactics which were later to become
so famous. And then his position is summarized further at the top
of Page 3. If I might read the last two sentences of the first paragraph
on that page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In spite of the fact that his duties took on immeasurable proportions
since the beginning of the huge U-boat construction
program, the chief was what he always was and always will
be: leader and inspiration to all the forces under him.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then the last sentence of that paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In spite of all his duties, he never lost touch with his men; and
he showed a masterly understanding in adjusting himself to
the changing fortunes of war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was not, however, only his ability as a naval officer which won
the defendant these high honors: his promotion to succeed the
Defendant Raeder as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, the personal
position he acquired as one of Hitler’s principal advisers, and finally,
earlier candidates, such as Göring, having betrayed Hitler’s trust
or finding the position less attractive than they had anticipated, the
doubtful honor of becoming Hitler’s successor. These he owed to
his fanatical adherence to Hitler and to the Party, to his belief in
the Nazi ideology with which he sought to indoctrinate the Navy and
the German people, and to his masterly understanding in adjusting
himself to the changing fortunes of war, referred to in the diary and
which the Tribunal may think, when I have referred them to the
document, may be regarded as synonymous with the capacity for
utter ruthlessness. His attitude to the Nazi Party and its creed is
shown by his public utterances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turn to the next document in the document book, D-443, which
I put in to become Exhibit GB-185. It is an extract from a speech
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>
made by the defendant at a meeting of commanders of the Navy
in Weimar on the 17th of December 1943. It was subsequently
circulated by the defendant as a top secret document for senior
officers only and by the hand of officers only. My Lord, if I might
read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I am a firm adherent of the idea of ideological education. For
what is it in the main? Doing his duty is a matter of course
for the soldier. But the full value, the whole weight of duty
done, is only present when the heart and spiritual conviction
have a voice in the matter. Doing his duty is then quite
different from what it would be if I only carried out my task
literally, obediently, and faithfully. It is therefore necessary
for the soldier to support the execution of his duty with all
his mental, all his spiritual energy; and for this his conviction,
his ideology are indispensable. It is therefore necessary for
us to train the soldier uniformly, comprehensively, that he
may be adjusted ideologically to our Germany. Every dualism,
every dissension in this connection, or every divergence or
unpreparedness imply a weakness in all circumstances. He in
whom this grows and thrives in unison is superior to the other.
Then indeed the whole importance, the whole weight of his
conviction comes into play. It is also nonsense to say that the
soldier or the officer must have no politics. The soldier
embodies the state in which he lives, he is the representative,
the articulate exponent of his state. He must therefore stand
with his whole weight behind this state.</p>
<hr class='tbk290'/>
<p class='noindent'>“We must travel this road out of our deepest conviction. The
Russian travels along it. We can only maintain ourselves in
this war if we take part in it, with holy zeal, with all our
fanaticism.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk291'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I alone cannot do this, but it can be done only with the aid
of the man who holds the production of Europe in his hand—with
Minister Speer. My ambition is to have as many warships
for the Navy as possible so as to be able to fight and to strike.
It does not matter to me who builds them.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, that last sentence is of importance in connection with
a later document. The Tribunal will see when I come to it that the
defendant was not above employing concentration camp labor for
this purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I put in the next document in the document book, D-640, which
becomes Exhibit GB-186. It is an extract from a speech on the
same subject by the defendant as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy
to the Commanders on the 15th of February 1944. My Lord, it is
cumulative except that I think the last two sentences add, if I might
read them:
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“From the very start the whole of the officer corps must be
so indoctrinated that it feels itself co-responsible for the
National Socialist State in its entirety. The officer is the
exponent of the State, the idle chatter that the officer is non-political
is sheer nonsense.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, the next document is 2878-PS, which I put in to become
Exhibit GB-187. It consists of three extracts from speeches. The first
is from a speech made by the defendant to the German Navy and
the German people on Heroes’ Day, the 12th of March 1944.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“German men and women!</p>
<hr class='tbk292'/>
<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What would have become of our country today, if the
Führer had not united us under National Socialism! Split into
parties, beset with the spreading poison of Jewry and vulnerable
to it, and lacking, as a defense, our present uncompromising
ideology, we would long since have succumbed to the
burdens of this war and been subject to the merciless
destruction of our adversaries.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next extract is from a speech to the Navy on the
21st of July 1944. It again shows the defendant’s fanaticism. It is
perhaps worth reading the first sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Men of the Navy! Holy wrath and unlimited anger fill our
hearts because of the criminal attempt which was to have cost
the life of our beloved Führer. Providence wished it otherwise,
watched over and protected our Führer, and did not abandon
our German fatherland in the fight for its destiny.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then he goes on to deal with the fate which should be meted
out to these traitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third extract deals with the introduction of the German
salute into the Armed Forces. I don’t think I need read it, but as
the members of the Tribunal will see, it was the Defendant Keitel
and this defendant who were responsible for the alteration of the
salute in the German forces and the adoption of the Nazi salute—together
with Göring.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Pardon, I should have said: the Defendants
Göring, Keitel, and Dönitz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document is a monitored report of the speech made on
the German wireless by this defendant, announcing the death of
Hitler and his own succession. It is Document D-444. I put it in to
become Exhibit GB-188, and I read a portion of it. The time is
2226—marked on the document. I read therefrom:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It has been reported from the Führer’s headquarters that our
Führer Adolf Hitler has died this afternoon in his battle headquarters
at the Reich Chancellery, fallen for Germany, fighting
to the last breath against Bolshevism.
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk293'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On the 30th of April the Führer nominated Grossadmiral
Dönitz to be his successor. The Grossadmiral and Führer’s
successor will speak to the German nation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then, the first paragraph of the speech:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“German men and women, soldiers of the German Armed
Forces. Our Führer Adolf Hitler is dead. The German people
bow in deepest sorrow and respect. Early he had recognized
the terrible danger of Bolshevism and had dedicated his life
to the fight against it. His fight having ended, he died a hero’s
death in the capital of the German Reich, after having led an
unmistakably straight and steady life.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then, that document also contains an order of the day issued by
the defendant, which is very much to the same effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from his services in building up the U-boat arm, there is
ample evidence that the defendant as officer commanding U-boats
took part in the planning and execution of aggressive war against
Poland, Norway, and Denmark. The next document in the document
book, C-126(c), has already been put in as Exhibit GB-45. It is a
memorandum by the Defendant Raeder, dated the 16th of May 1939,
and I will call the attention of the Tribunal to the distribution. The
sixth copy went to the Führer der Unterseeboote, that is to say, to
the Defendant Dönitz. The document is a directive for the invasion
of Poland, Fall Weiss, and I won’t read it. It has already been read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document, C-126(e), on the second page of that same
document, has also been put in as Exhibit GB-45. It again is a
memorandum from the Defendant Raeder’s headquarters, dated the
2d of August 1939. It is addressed to the fleet, and then Flag Officer
U-boats—that is, of course, the defendant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and it is merely a
covering letter for operational directions for the employment of
U-boats which are to be sent out into the Atlantic by way of precaution
in the event the intention of carrying out Fall Weiss should
remain unchanged. The second sentence is important:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Flag Officer U-boats is handing in his operation orders to
SKL”—that is the Seekriegsleitung, the German Admiralty—“by
12 August. A decision on the sailings of U-boats for the
Atlantic will probably be made in the middle of August.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next document, C-172, I put in as Exhibit GB-189. It consists
of the defendant’s own operational instructions to his U-boats for
the operation Fall Weiss. It is signed by him. It is not dated, but it
is clear from the subject matter that its date must be before the
16th of July 1939. I don’t think the substance of the document adds.
It is purely an operational instruction, giving effect to the document
already put in, C-126(c), the directive by Raeder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next document, C-122, has already been put in as
Exhibit GB-82. It is an extract from the War Diary of the naval
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>
war staff of the German Admiralty, dated the 3rd of October 1939,
and records the fact that the chief of the naval war staff has called
for views on the possibility of taking operational bases in Norway.
It has already been read and I would merely call the Tribunal’s
attention to the passage in brackets, in the paragraph marked “d”:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Flag Officer U-boats already considers such harbors extremely
useful as equipment and supply bases for Atlantic U-boats to
call at temporarily.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next document, C-5, has already been put in as Exhibit
GB-83. This is from the defendant, as Flag Officer U-boats,
addressed to the Supreme Command of the Navy, the naval war
staff. It is dated the 9th of October 1939, and it sets out the
defendant’s view on the advantages of Trondheim and Narvik as
bases. The document proposes the establishment of a base at Trondheim
with Narvik as an alternative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the next document, C-151, has already been put in as
Exhibit GB-91. It is the defendant’s operation order to his U-boats
for the occupation of Denmark and Norway, and the operation order,
which is top secret, dated the 30th of March 1940, is termed “Hartmut.”
The members of the Tribunal will remember that the document,
in the last paragraph, said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The naval force will, as they enter the harbor, fly the British
flag until the troops have landed, except presumably at
Narvik.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The preparations for war against England are perhaps best
shown by the disposition of the U-boats under his command on the
3rd of September 1939, when war broke out between Germany and
the Western Allies. The locations of the sinkings in the following
week, including that of the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> which will be dealt with by my
learned friend, Major Elwyn Jones, provide corroboration. On that,
I would put in two charts; I put them in as Document D-652, and
they become Exhibit GB-190.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I have copies here for the members of the Tribunal.
They have been prepared by the Admiralty. There are two charts.
The first sets out the disposition of the submarines on the 3rd of
September 1939. There is a certification attached to the chart, in the
top left-hand corner, which I should read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This chart has been constructed from a study of the orders
issued by Dönitz between 21 August 1939 and 3 September
1939 and subsequently captured. The chart shows the approximate
disposition of submarines ordered for the 3rd of September
1939 but it cannot be guaranteed accurate in every
detail as the files of captured orders are clearly not complete
and also some of the submarines shown apparently had
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
received orders at sea on or about 3 September to move to
new operational areas. The documents from which this chart
was constructed are held by the British Admiralty in London.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, there are two points I would make on that first chart.
First, it will be apparent to members of the Tribunal that U-boats
which were in those positions on the 3rd of September 1939 had left
Kiel some considerable time before. The other point which I would
make is important in connection with my learned friend Major
Elwyn Jones’ case against the Defendant Raeder, and that is the
location of the U-boat U-30. The members of the Tribunal may care
to bear it in mind while looking at the charts now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second chart sets out the sinkings during the first week of
the war, and the location of the sinking of the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> will be noted.
There is a short certification in the left-hand corner of the Tribunal’s
copies:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This chart has been constructed from the official records of
the British Admiralty in London. It shows the positions of
the sinkings of the British merchant vessels lost by enemy
action in the 7 days commencing the 3rd of September 1939.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I turn to the defendant’s participation in War Crimes
and Crimes against Humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The course of the war waged against neutral and Allied merchant
shipping by the U-boats followed under the defendant’s direction
a course of consistently increasing ruthlessness. The defendant
displayed his masterly understanding in adjusting himself to the
changing fortunes of war. From the very early days, merchant
ships, both Allied and neutral, were sunk without warning; and
when operational danger zones had been announced by the German
Admiralty, these sinkings continued to take place both within and
without those zones. With some exceptions in the early days of the
war, no regard was taken for the safety of the crews or passengers
of sunk merchant ships, and the announcement claiming a total
blockade of the British Isles merely served to confirm the established
situation under which U-boat warfare was being conducted without
regard to the established rules of international warfare or the
requirements of humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The course of the war at sea during the first 18 months is
summarized by two official British reports made at a time when
those who compiled them were ignorant of some of the actual
orders issued which have since come to hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I turn to the next document in the document book. It
is Document D-641(a), which I put in to become Exhibit GB-191. It
is an extract from an official report of the British Foreign Office
concerning German attacks on merchant shipping during the period
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
3 September 1939 to September 1940, that is to say, the first year
of the war, and it was made shortly after September 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, if I might quote from the second paragraph on the
first page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the first 12 months of the war, 2,081,062 tons of
Allied shipping comprising 508 ships have been lost by
enemy action. In addition, 769,213 tons of neutral shipping,
comprising 253 ships, have also been lost. Nearly all these
merchant ships have been sunk by submarine, mine, aircraft,
or surface craft, and the great majority of them were sunk
while engaged on their lawful trading voyages. 2,836 Allied
merchant seamen have lost their lives in these ships.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk294'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In the last war the practice of the central powers was so
remote from the recognized procedure that it was thought
necessary to set forth once again the rules of warfare in
particular as applied to submarines. This was done in the
Treaty of London, 1930; and in 1936 Germany acceded to
the rules. The rules laid down:</p>
<hr class='tbk295'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(1) In action with regard to merchant ships, submarines
must conform to the rules of international law to which
surface vessels are subjected.</p>
<hr class='tbk296'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(2) In particular, except in the case of persistent refusal to stop
on being summoned or of active resistance to visit and search,
a warship, whether surface vessel or submarine, may not
sink or render incapable of navigation a merchant vessel
without having first placed passengers, crew, and ships’ papers
in a place of safety. For this purpose, the ship’s boats are
not regarded as a place of safety unless the safety of the
passengers and crew is assured in the existing sea and
weather conditions by the proximity of land or the presence
of another vessel which is in a position to take them on
board.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then, the next paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At the beginning of the present war, Germany issued a
prize ordinance for the regulation of sea warfare and the
guidance of her naval officers. Article 74 of this ordinance
embodies the submarine rules of the London Treaty.
Article 72, however, provides that captured enemy vessels
may be destroyed if it seems inexpedient or unsafe to bring
them into port, and Article 73 (i) and (ii) makes the same
provision with regard to neutral vessels which are captured
for sailing under enemy convoy, for forcible resistance, or for
giving assistance to the enemy. These provisions are certainly
not in accordance with the traditional British view but the
important point is that, even in these cases, the prize
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>
ordinance envisages the capture of the merchantman before
its destruction. In other words, if the Germans adhered to
the rules set out in their own prize ordinance, we might have
argued the rather fine legal point with them, but we should
have no quarrel with them, either on the broader legal issue
or on the humanitarian one. In the event, however, it is only
too clear that almost from the beginning of the war the
Germans abandoned their own principles and waged war
with steadily increasing disregard for international law, and
for what is, after all, the ultimate sanction of all law, the
protection of human life and property from arbitrary and
ruthless attacks.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I pass to the third paragraph on the next page which sets out
two instances:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the 30th of September 1939 came the first sinking of a
neutral ship by a submarine without warning and with loss
of life. This was the Danish ship <span class='it'>Vendia</span> bound for the Clyde
in ballast. The submarine fired two shots and shortly after
torpedoed the ship. The torpedo was fired when the master
had already signaled that he would submit to the submarine’s
orders and before there had been an opportunity to abandon
ship. By November submarines were beginning to sink neutral
vessels without warning as a regular thing. On the 12th
November the Norwegian <span class='it'>Arne Kjode</span> was torpedoed in the
North Sea without any warning at all. This was a tanker
bound from one neutral port to another. The master and four
of the crew lost their lives and the remainder were picked
up after many hours in open boats. Henceforward, in addition
to the failure to establish the nature of the cargo, another
element is noticeable, namely an increasing recklessness as to
the fate of the crew.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then dealing with attacks on Allied merchant vessels,
certain figures are given: Ships sunk 241, recorded attacks 221,
illegal attacks 112. At least 79 of these 112 ships were torpedoed
without warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Then they were not illegally
sunk, however?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): According to this document, the
Germans have been given the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Oh, yes, I should have read that sentence;
I am obliged to Your Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pass to the second report, Document D-641(b). It is part of the
same document and is put in as Exhibit GB-191. It is a report
covering the next 6 months from September 1, 1940.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you not reading Page 3?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: If Your Lordship pleases, I have read a
great deal of the report and there are passages that I had not
considered important.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I haven’t myself read it, but I think.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: If I might read the first two paragraphs
on Page 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“By the middle of October submarines were sinking merchant
vessels without any regard to the safety of the crews. Yet
4 months later the Germans were still officially claiming that
they were acting in accordance with their prize ordinance.
Their own semi-official commentators, however, had made
the position clear. As regards neutrals, Berlin officials had
early in February stated that any neutral ship that is either
voluntarily or under compulsion bound for an enemy port—including
contraband control harbors—thereby loses its
neutrality and must be considered hostile. At the end of
February the cat was let out of the bag by a statement that
a neutral ship which obtained a navicert from a British consul
in order to avoid putting into a British contraband control
base was liable to be sunk by German submarines, even if
it was bound from one neutral port to another. As regards
Allied ships, in the middle of November 1939 a Berlin warning
was issued against the arming of British vessels. By that
date a score of British merchantmen had been illegally
attacked by gunfire or torpedo from submarines, and after
the date some 15 more unarmed Allied vessels were torpedoed
without warning. It is clear therefore that not only
was the arming fully justified as a defensive measure but
also that neither before nor after this German threat did the
German submarines discriminate between armed and unarmed
vessels.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The last paragraph is merely a summing-up; it does not add.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning to D-641(b), which is a similar report covering the next
6 months, if I might read the first five paragraphs of Page 1:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the 30th January 1941 Hitler proclaimed: ‘Every ship,
with or without convoy, which appears before our torpedo
tubes is going to be torpedoed. On the face of it, this
announcement appears to be uncompromising; and the only
qualification provided by the context is that the threats
immediately preceding it are specifically addressed to the
peoples of the American Continent. German commentators,
however, subsequently tried to water it down by contending
that Hitler was referring only to ships which attempted to
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
enter the area within which the German ‘total blockade’ is
alleged to be in force.</p>
<hr class='tbk297'/>
<p class='noindent'>“From one point of view it probably matters little what
exactly was Hitler’s meaning, since the only conclusion that
can be reached after a study of the facts of enemy warfare
on merchant shipping is that enemy action in this field is
never limited by the principles which are proclaimed by
enemy spokesmen, but solely by the opportunities or lack of
them which exist at any given time.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Phillimore, isn’t this document you
are now reading really legal argument?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, some of it is. The difficulty is
to leave those parts and take in the facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: The third paragraph, if I might leave the
rest of the second, is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The effect of the German ‘total blockade’ is to prohibit
neutral ships from entering an enormous stretch of sea round
Britain (the area extends to about 500 miles west of Ireland,
and from the latitude of Bordeaux to that of the Faroe
Islands), upon pain of having their ships sunk without warning
and their crews killed. As a matter of fact, at least
32 neutral ships, exclusive of those sailing in British convoys,
have been sunk by enemy action since the declaration of the
‘total blockade.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The last sentence in the following paragraph about the sinking
of ships without warning:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Yet though information is lacking in very many cases,
details are available to prove that, during the period under
review, at least 38 Allied merchant ships exclusive of those
in convoys have been torpedoed without warning in or near
the ‘total blockade’ area.</p>
<hr class='tbk298'/>
<p class='noindent'>“That the Germans themselves have no exaggerated regard
for the area is proved by the fact that of the 38 ships referred
to at least 16 were torpedoed outside the limits of the war
zone.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next page deals with a specific case illustrating the
matter set out above. It is in the first paragraph of that page, the
third sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The sinking of the <span class='it'>City of Benares</span> on the 17th September
1940 is a good example of this. The <span class='it'>City of Benares</span> was an
11,000-ton liner with 191 passengers on board, including
nearly 100 children. She was torpedoed without warning just
outside the ‘war zone,’ with the loss of 258 lives, including
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>
77 children. It was blowing a gale, with hail and rain squalls
and a very rough sea when the torpedo struck her at about
10 p. m. In the darkness and owing to the prevailing weather
conditions, at least four of the 12 boats lowered were
capsized. Others were swamped and many people were
washed right off. In one boat alone 16 people, including
11 children, died from exposure; in another 22 died, including
15 children; in a third 21 died. The point to be emphasized
is not the unusual brutality of this attack but rather that
such results are inevitable when a belligerent disregards the
rules of sea warfare as the Germans have done and are doing.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I think the rest of that paragraph is not important.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turn to the next document, 641(c), which is part of Exhibit
GB-191.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is clear, I suppose, from that statement of
facts that there was no warning whatever given?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: No, My Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We think that you should read the next
paragraph too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: If Your Lordship pleases.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“There are hundreds of similar stories, stories of voyages for
days in open boats in Atlantic gales, of men in the water
clinging for hours to a raft and gradually dropping off one
by one, of crews being machine-gunned as they tried to
lower their boats or as they drifted away in them, of seamen
being blown to pieces by shells and torpedoes and bombs.
The enemy must know that such things are the inevitable
result of the type of warfare he has chosen to employ.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>My Lord, the rest is very much to the same general effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The document, 641(c), is merely a certificate giving the total
sinkings by U-boats during the war (1939 to 1945) as 2,775 British,
Allied, and neutral ships totalling 14,572,435 gross registered tons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it is perhaps worth considering one example not
quoted in the above reports of the ruthless nature of the actions
conducted by the defendant’s U-boat commanders, particularly as
both British and German versions of the sinkings are available.
I turn to the next document, “The sinking of S. S. <span class='it'>Sheaf Mead</span>.”
That is Document D-644, which I put in as Exhibit GB-192. If I
might read the opening paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The British S. S. <span class='it'>Sheaf Mead</span> was torpedoed without
warning on 27 May 1940.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This is the German account, is it not?
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: This is actually in the form of a British
report. It includes the German account in the shape of a complete
extract from the log.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It bears the words, “top secret”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Yes, My Lord, this was at the time a top secret
document. That was some while ago.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The British S. S. <span class='it'>Sheaf Mead</span> was torpedoed without warning
on 27 May 1940, with the loss of 31 of the crew. The
commander of the U-boat responsible is reported to have
behaved in an exceptionally callous manner towards the men
clinging to upturned boats and pieces of wood. It was thought
that this man was Kapitänleutnant Öhrn of <span class='it'>U-37</span>: The
following extract from his log for 27 May 1940 leaves no
doubt on the matter and speaks for itself as to his behaviour.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Again turning to the relevant extract from the log, on the second
page, the time is marked on the document as 1554.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Surface. Stern is underwater.”—referring to the ship which
has been torpedoed—“Stern is underwater. Bows rise
higher. The boats are now on the water. Lucky for them.
A picture of complete order. They lie at some distance. The
bows rear up quite high. Two men appear from somewhere
in the forward part of the ship. They leap and rush with
great bounds along the deck down the stern. The stern
disappears. A boat capsizes. Then a boiler explosion. Two
men fly through the air, limbs outstretched. Bursting and
crushing. Then all is over. A large heap of wreckage floats
up. We approach it to identify the name. The crew have
saved themselves on wreckage and capsized boats. We fish
out a buoy. No name on it. I ask a man on the raft. He says,
hardly turning his head, ‘Nix Name.’ A young boy in the
water calls, ‘Help, help, please!’ The others are very composed.
They look damp and somewhat tired. An expression
of cold hatred is on their faces. On to the old course. After
washing the paint off the buoy, the name comes to light:
Greatafield, Glasgow, 5,006 gross registered tons.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>“On to the old course” means merely that the U-boat makes off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the next page of that document contains an extract from
the report of the chief engineer of the <span class='it'>Sheaf Mead</span>. The relevant
paragraphs are the first and the last:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“When I came to the surface I found myself on the port side,
that is, nearest to the submarine, which was only about
5 yards away. The submarine captain asked the steward
the name of the ship, which he told him, and the enemy
picked up one of our lifebuoys, but this had the name
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
Greatafield on it, as this was the name of our ship before it
was changed to <span class='it'>Sheaf Mead</span> last January.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“She had cut-away bows, but I did notice a net-cutter. Two
men stood at the side with boat-hooks to keep us off.</p>
<hr class='tbk299'/>
<p class='noindent'>“They cruised around for half an hour, taking photographs
of us in the water. Otherwise they just watched us, but said
nothing. Then she submerged and went off, without offering
us any assistance whatever.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is there any suggestion in the German report
that any warning was given?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: No, My Lord. It is quite clear, indeed, that
it was not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the time 1414 there is a description of the sighting
of the ship and the difficulty in identifying; and then at the top
of the page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The distance apart is narrowing. The steamship draws in
quickly, but the position is still 40-50. I cannot see the stern
yet. Tube ready. Shall I or not? The gunnery crews are also
prepared. On the ship’s side a yellow cross in a small,
square, dark blue ground. Swedish? Presumably not. I raise
the periscope a little. Hurrah, a gun at the stern, an A/A gun
or something similar. Fire! It cannot miss.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”—and then
the sinking.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now that it is possible to examine some of the actual documents
by which the defendant and his fellow conspirators issued their
orders in disregard of international law, you may think the
compilers of the above reports understated the case. These orders
cover not only the period referred to in the reports, but also the
subsequent course of the war. It is interesting to note in them
the steps by which the defendants progressed. At first they were
content with breaching the rules of international law to the extent
of sinking merchant ships, including neutral ships, without warning
where there was a reasonable prospect of being able to do so without
discovery. The facts already quoted show that the question of
whether ships were defensively armed or outside the declared
operational areas was in practice immaterial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I go to the next document in the document book, C-191, which
I put in as Exhibit GB-193. That is a memorandum by the German
naval war staff, dated 22 September 1939. It sets out:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Flag Officer U-boats intends to give permission to U-boats to
sink without warning any vessels sailing without lights.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Reading from the third sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In practice there is no opportunity for attacking at night,
as the U-boat cannot identify a target which is a shadow in
a way that entirely obviates mistakes being made. If the
political situation is such that even possible mistakes must be
ruled out, U-boats must be forbidden to make any attacks at
night in waters where French and English naval forces or
merchant ships may be situated. On the other hand, in sea
areas where only English units are to be expected, the
measures desired by Flag Officer U-boats can be carried
out; permission to take this step is not to be given in writing,
but need merely be based on the unspoken approval of the
Naval Operations Staff.</p>
<hr class='tbk300'/>
<p class='noindent'>“U-boat commanders should be informed by word of mouth,
and the sinking of a merchant ship must be justified in the
War Diary as due to possible confusion with a warship or an
auxiliary cruiser. In the meanwhile, U-boats in the English
Channel have received instructions to attack all vessels
sailing without lights.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now I go to the next document, C-21, which I put in as Exhibit
GB-194. My Lord, this document consists of a series of extracts
from the War Diary of the German naval war staff of the German
Admiralty. The second extract, at Page 5, relates a conference
with the head of the naval war staff, report of the 2 January 1940,
and then reading:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1) Report by Ia”—that is the Staff Officer Operations on the
naval war staff.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Shouldn’t you read above that, Paragraph 1/b?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Yes, if Your Lordship pleases. It is important.
The others are much to the same effect. If I might read it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Report by Ia.”—This is one report by Ia on the directive of
Armed Forces High Command of 30 December.</p>
<hr class='tbk301'/>
<p class='noindent'>“According to this, the Führer, on report of Commander-in-Chief
of the Navy, has decided: (a) Greek merchant vessels
are to be treated as enemy vessels in the zone blockaded by
U.S.A. and Britain; (b) in the Bristol Channel all ships may
be attacked without warning. For external consumption
these attacks should be given out as hits by mines. Both
measures may be taken with immediate effect.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next extract, a report by Ia, that is, the Staff Officer
Operations on the naval war staff on the directive of Armed Forces
High Command, dated 30 December:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Referring to intensified measures in naval and air warfare
in connection with ‘Fall Gelb’.
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk302'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In consequence of this directive, the Navy is authorized,
simultaneously with the general intensification of the war,
to sink by U-boats, without any warning, all ships in those
waters near the enemy coasts in which mines can be
employed. In this case, for external consumption, pretence
should be made that mines are being used. The behaviour
of, and use of weapons by, U-boats should be adapted to
this purpose.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then the third extract, dated 6 January 1940:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. pursuant to the Führer’s consent on principle (see
minutes of report of Commander-in-Chief Navy of 30 December)
to authorize firing without warning while maintaining
the pretence of mine hits in certain parts of the
American blockade zone.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Well, then the order is given to Flag Officer U-boats carrying
out that decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next extract, dated the 18th of January 1940, adds to some
extent, and if I may read it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The High Command of the Armed Forces has issued the
following directive dated 17th of January, cancelling the
previous order concerning intensified measures of warfare
against merchantmen.</p>
<hr class='tbk303'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Navy is authorized, with immediate effect, to sink by
U-boats without warning all ships in those waters near the
enemy coasts in which the use of mines is possible.”—My
Lord, that is an extension of the area.—“U-boats must adapt
their behavior and employment of weapons to the pretence,
which is to be maintained in these cases, that the hits were
caused by mines. Ships of the United States, Italy, Japan,
and Russia are exempted from these attacks.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Well, then there is a note emphasizing the point about maintaining
the pretense of mine hits and the last extract is, I think, purely
cumulative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document, C-118, I put in as Exhibit GB-195. This is
an extract from the B.d.U. War Diary, that is to say the defendant’s
war diary. It is dated the 18th of July 1941, and it consists of a
further extension of that order by the cutting down of the
protected categories.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Supplementary to the order forbidding, for the time being,
attacks on U.S. warships and merchant vessels in the operational
area of the North Atlantic, the Führer has ordered the
following:</p>
<hr class='tbk304'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. Attacks on U.S. merchant vessels sailing in British or U.S.
convoys, or independently are authorized in the original
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
operational area which corresponds in its dimensions to the
U.S. blockade zone and which does not include the sea-route
U.S. to Iceland.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As the members of the Tribunal will have seen from these
orders, at one date the ships of a particular neutral under certain
conditions could be sunk while those of another could not. It would
be easy to put before the Tribunal a mass of orders and instances
to show that the attitude to be adopted toward ships of particular
neutrals changed at various times. The point is that the defendant
conducted the U-boat war against neutrals with complete cynicism
and opportunism. It all depended on the political relationship of
Germany toward a particular country at a particular time whether
her ships were sunk or not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I turn to the next document in the document book,
D-642, which I put in as Exhibit GB-196. My Lord, this is a series
of orders; the first, I should say, of a series of orders leading up to
the issue of an order which enjoined the U-boat commanders not
merely to abstain from rescuing crews, which is the purpose of this
order, not merely to give them no assistance but deliberately to
annihilate them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, in the course of my proof of this matter, I shall call
two witnesses. The first witness will give the Court an account of a
speech made by the defendant at the time that he issued the order
describing the policy, or his policy toward the recovery of Allied
troops: that it must be stopped at all costs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second witness is the officer who actually briefed crews on
the order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, this document is an extract from the standing orders of
the U-boat command, an extract from Standing Order Number 154,
and it is signed by the defendant:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Paragraph e) Do not pick up men or take them with you. Do
not worry about the merchant ship’s boats. Weather conditions
and distance from land play no part. Have a care only for
your own ship and strive only to attain your next success as
soon as possible. We must be harsh in this war. The enemy
began the war in order to destroy us, so nothing else matters.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is the date of that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, that order, the copy we have, is
not dated, but a later order, Number 173, which was issued concurrently
with an operational order, is dated the 2d of May 1940.
The Tribunal may take it, it is earlier than the 2d of May 1940.
My Lord, that is a secret order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Earlier than May 1940?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Earlier than May 1940.
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, however, in 1942, when the United States entered the war
with its enormous shipbuilding capacity, that the change thus
brought about necessitated a further adjustment in the methods
adopted by the U-boats and of the defendant; and the defendant was
guilty of an order which intended not merely the sinking of merchant
ships, not merely the abstention from rescue of the crews, but their
deliberate extermination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next document in the document book shows the
course of events, Document D-423, and I put it in as Exhibit GB-197.
It is a record of a conversation between Hitler and the Japanese
Ambassador Oshima, in the presence of the Defendant Ribbentrop,
on the 3 of January 1942.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Führer, using a map, explains to the Japanese Ambassador
the present position of marine warfare in the Atlantic,
emphasizing that what he considers his most important task
is to get the U-boat warfare going in full swing. The U-boats
are being re-organized. Firstly, he had recalled all U-boats
operating in the Atlantic. As mentioned before, they would
now be posted outside United States ports. Later, they would
be off Freetown and the larger boats even as far down as
Capetown.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then, after further details:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“After having given further explanations on the map, the
Führer pointed out that, however many ships the United
States built, one of their main problems would be the lack
of personnel. For that reason even merchant ships would be
sunk without warning with the intention of killing as many
of the crew as possible. Once it gets around that most of the
seamen are lost in the sinkings, the Americans would soon
have difficulties in enlisting new people. The training of
sea-going personnel takes a very long time. We are fighting
for our existence and our attitude cannot be ruled by any
humane feelings. For this reason he must give the order that
in case foreign seamen could not be taken prisoner, which is
in most cases not possible on the sea, U-boats were to surface
after torpedoing and shoot up the lifeboats.</p>
<hr class='tbk305'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Ambassador Oshima heartily agreed with the Führer’s
comments, and said that the Japanese, too, are forced to
follow these methods.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next document, D-446, I put in as Exhibit GB-198.
I do not propose to read it. It is an extract from B. d. U. War
Diary of the 16th of September 1942; and it is part of the story in
the sense that it was on the following day that the order I complain
of was issued, and the Defense will, no doubt, wish to rely on it. It
records an attack on a U-boat which was rescuing survivors, chiefly
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
the Italian survivors of the Allied liner <span class='it'>Laconia</span>, when it was
attacked by an Allied aircraft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next document, D-630, I put in as Exhibit GB-199.
It contains four documents. The first is a top secret order, sent
to all commanding officers of U-boats from the defendant’s
headquarters, dated 17th of September 1942:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. No attempt of any kind must be made at rescuing
members of ships sunk; and this includes picking up persons
in the water and putting them in lifeboats, righting capsized
lifeboats and handing over food and water. Rescue runs
counter to the rudimentary demands of warfare for the destruction
of enemy ships and crews.</p>
<hr class='tbk306'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. Orders for bringing in captains and chief engineers still
apply.</p>
<hr class='tbk307'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. Rescue the shipwrecked only if their statements will be of
importance to your boat.</p>
<hr class='tbk308'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4. Be harsh, having in mind that the enemy takes no regard
of women and children in his bombing attacks on German
cities.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, My Lord, that is, of course, a very carefully worded order.
Its intentions are made very clear by the next document on that
same page, which is an extract from the defendant’s war diary;
and I should say there, as appears from the copy handed in to the
Court, the war diary is personally signed by the Defendant Dönitz.
It is the war diary entry for the 17th of September 1942:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The attention of all commanding officers is again drawn”—and
I would draw the Tribunal’s attention to the word
“again”—“to the fact that all efforts to rescue members of the
crews of ships which have been sunk contradict the most
primitive demands for the conduct of warfare for annihilating
enemy ships and their crews. Orders concerning the bringing
in of the captains and chief engineers still stand.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The last two documents on that page consist of a telegram from
the commander of the U-boat <span class='it'>Schacht</span> to the defendant’s headquarters
and the reply. <span class='it'>Schacht</span> had been taking part in the
rescue of survivors from the <span class='it'>Laconia</span>. The telegram from <span class='it'>Schacht</span>,
dated the 17th of September 1942, reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“163 Italians handed over to <span class='it'>Annamite</span>. Navigating officer
of <span class='it'>Laconia</span> and another English officer on board.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then it goes on setting out the position of English and Polish
survivors in boats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reply sent on the 20th:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Action as in wireless telegram message of 17th of September
was wrong. Boat was detailed to rescue Italian allies and
not for the rescue of English and Poles.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a small point, but of course “detailed” means before the
bombing incident had ever occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then as for the next document, D-663, that was issued later
and may not yet have been inserted in the Tribunal’s Document
Book; D-663 I put in as Exhibit GB-200. My Lord, this is an
extract from an operation order, “Operation Order Atlantic
Number 56,” dated the 7th of October 1943, and the copy put in
is part of sailing orders to a U-boat. As I shall prove through the
second witness, although the date of this order is the 7th of October
1943, in fact it is only a reproduction of an order issued very much
earlier, in the autumn of 1942.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Rescue ships: A so-called rescue ship is generally attached to
every convoy, a special ship of up to 3,000 gross registered
tons, which is intended for the picking up of survivors after
U-boat attacks. These ships are for the most part equipped
with a shipborne aircraft and large motorboats, are strongly
armed with depth charge throwers, and are very maneuverable,
so that they are often taken for U-boat traps by the
commander.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then, the last sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“In view of the desired destruction of ships’ crews, their
sinking is of great value.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>If I might just sum up those documents, it would appear from
the War Diary entry of the 17th of September that orders on the
lines discussed between Hitler and Oshima were, in fact, issued, but
we have not captured them. It may be they were issued orally
and that the defendant awaited a suitable opportunity before confirming
them. The incident of the bombing of the U-boats detailed
to rescue the Italian survivors from the <span class='it'>Laconia</span> afforded the
opportunity and the order to all commanders was issued. Its intent
is very clear when you consider it in the light of the War Diary
entry. The wording is, of course, extremely careful but to any
officer of experience its intention was obvious and he would know
that deliberate action to annihilate survivors would be approved
under that order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You will be told that this order, although perhaps unfortunately
phrased, was merely intended to stop a commander from jeopardizing
his ship by attempting a rescue, which had become
increasingly dangerous, as a result of the extended coverage of the
ocean by Allied aircraft; and that the notorious action of the U-boat
Commander Eck in sinking the Greek steamer <span class='it'>Peleus</span> and then
machine-gunning the crew on their rafts in the water, was an
exception; and that, although it may be true that a copy of the
order was on board, this action was taken solely, as he himself
swore, on his own initiative.
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I would make the point to the Tribunal that if the intention of
this order was to stop the rescue attempts in the interests of the
preservation of the U-boat, first of all it would have been done by
calling attention to Standing Order 154.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Second, this very fact would have been prominently stated in
the order. Drastic orders of this nature are not drafted by experienced
staff officers without the greatest care and an eye to their possible
capture by the enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Third, if it was necessary to avoid the risks attendant on
standing by or surfacing, not only would this have been stated but
there would have been no question of taking any prisoners at all
except possibly in circumstances where virtually no risk in
surfacing was to be apprehended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fourth, the final sentence of the first paragraph would have read
very differently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And fifth, if, in fact—and the Prosecution do not for one moment
accept it—the defendant did not mean to enjoin murder, his order
was so worded that he cannot escape the responsibility which
attaches to such a document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I would call my first witness, Peter Heisig.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness, Peter Josef Heisig, took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is your name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PETER JOSEF HEISIG (Witness): My name is Peter Josef
Heisig.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Say this: “I swear by God—the Almighty
and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure truth—and will withhold
nothing and add nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath in German.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Peter Josef Heisig, are you an Oberleutnant
zur See in Germany?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: I am Oberleutnant zur See in the German Navy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: And were you captured on the 27th of
December 1944, and now held as a prisoner of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Did you swear an affidavit on the 27th of
November 1945?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: And is that your signature? [<span class='it'>Document
D-566 was submitted to the witness.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, that is the Document D-566.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: That is the document I signed.
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: I put that in as Exhibit GB-201.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Will you take your mind back to the
autumn of 1942? What rank did you hold at that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: I was senior midshipman at the 2d U-boat Training
Division.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Were you attending a course there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: I took part in the training course for U-boat officers
of the watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Do you remember the last day of the
course?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: On the last day of the course, Grossadmiral Dönitz,
who was then Commander-in-Chief of the U-boats, reviewed the
2d U-boat Training Division.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: And what happened at the end of this
tour?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: At the end of his visit—not at the end but rather
during his visit—Grossadmiral Dönitz made a speech before the
officers of the 2d U-boat Training Division.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Can you fix the date of his visit?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: I remember the approximate date; it must have been
at the end of September or the beginning of October 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Now, will you give the Tribunal—speaking
slowly—an account of what Admiral Dönitz said in his speech?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: Grossadmiral Dönitz said in his speech that the
successes of the U-boats had declined. The strength of enemy air
control was responsible for that decline. New antiaircraft guns had
been developed which would in future make it possible for the
U-boats to fight off enemy aircraft. Hitler had personally given him
the assurance that U-boats would be equipped with these antiaircraft
guns before all other branches of the Armed Forces. It could be
expected therefore that the successes of former times would be
reached again within a few months. After speaking about his good
relations with Hitler, Grossadmiral Dönitz discussed the German
armament program.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A question by an officer regarding a newspaper article which stated
that the Allied countries were building more than a million tons of
merchant shipping every month, Admiral Dönitz answered by
saying that he doubted the credibility of this estimate and said it
was based on an announcement by President Roosevelt. He then
spoke briefly about President Roosevelt, about the American production
program and armament potential, and added that the Allies
had great difficulty in manning their ships. Allied seamen considered
the route across the Atlantic dangerous, because German
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
U-boats were sinking Allied ships in great numbers. Many of the
Allied seamen had been torpedoed more than once; these facts
spread and make the seamen reluctant to go to sea again. Some of
them were even trying to shirk a crossing of the Atlantic, so that
the Allied authorities were compelled, if it became necessary, to
retain the men aboard by force of law. Such indications were
favorable to the Germans. From the facts that, firstly, the Allies were
building very many new merchant ships and, secondly, that the
Allies were having considerable difficulties in manning these newly
built ships, Admiral Dönitz concluded that the question of personnel
was a very grave matter for the Allies. The losses in men affected
the Allies especially seriously, because they had few reserves and
also because.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: I don’t want to interrupt you, but did he
say anything about rescues at all? You have told us about the
Allied losses and how serious they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: Yes, he mentioned rescues, but I would like to speak
about that later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grossadmiral Dönitz said that the losses of the Allies affected
them very seriously, because they had no reserves and also because
the training of new seamen required a very long time. He could
not, therefore, understand it, if submarines were still.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Phillimore, just a moment. I don’t
think we want to hear the whole of Admiral Dönitz’ speech. We
want to hear the material part of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE [<span class='it'>to the witness.</span>]: Now, you have dealt with
the question of losses. Will you come to the crucial part of the
speech, at the end, and deal with that? What did the Grand Admiral
go on to say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: The testimony of the witness does not concern me
directly, but I have an objection to raise. According to German law
and according to the German Code of Criminal Procedure, the
witness must say everything he knows about a matter. If he is
asked about a speech of Grossadmiral Dönitz, he must not, at least
according to German law, relate only those parts which, in the
opinion of the Prosecution, are unfavorable to the defendant. I
believe this principle should also apply in these proceedings,
whenever a witness is questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal is not bound by German law.
I have already said that the Tribunal does not desire to hear from
this witness all of Admiral Dönitz’ speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be open to any of the counsel for the defendants to
cross-examine this witness. Your intervention is therefore entirely
unnecessary.
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE [<span class='it'>to the witness.</span>]: Now, will you deal with
the crucial parts of the Grand Admiral’s speech?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: Grossadmiral Dönitz continued, saying approximately
that under the circumstances he could not understand how German
U-boats could still rescue the crews of the merchant ships they had
sunk, thereby endangering their own ships. By doing that, they
were working for the enemy, since these rescued crews would sail
again on new ships.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stage had now been reached in which total war had to be
waged also at sea. The crews of ships, like the ships themselves,
were a target for the U-boats; thus it would be impossible for the
Allies to man their newly-built ships; and moreover it could then
be expected that in America and the other Allied countries a
strike would break out, for already a part of the seamen did not
want to go back to sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These results could be expected if our tactics would render the
war at sea more vigorous. If any of us consider this war or these
tactics harsh we should also remember that our wives and our
families at home are being bombed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That, in its main points, was the speech of Grossadmiral Dönitz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Now, about how many officers were
present and heard that speech?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: I have no experience in fixing the number of people
present at large indoor gatherings. I can only give you a rough
estimate: approximately 120 officers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, the witness is available for
cross-examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does the United States prosecutor wish to ask
any question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Soviet prosecutor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French prosecutor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, any of the defendants’ counsel may cross-examine the
witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER OTTO KRANZBÜHLER (Counsel for
Defendant Dönitz): I represent Grossadmiral Dönitz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Counsel will understand that what I said to
Dr. Thoma was not intended to interfere with your cross-examination;
it was only intended to save time. The Tribunal did
not desire to hear unimportant passages in the Defendant Dönitz’
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
speech. Therefore, they did not want to hear them from this
witness. However, you are at liberty to ask any questions that you
please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Oberleutnant Heisig, did
you yourself take part in an action against the enemy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: On which boat were you,
and who was your commander?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: I was on U-877, under Kapitänleutnant Finkeisen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Please repeat your answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: I served on U-877 in an action against the enemy, and
the commander was Kapitänleutnant Finkeisen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Were you successful in
action against enemy ships?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: The boat was sunk on its way to the area of operations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Before you were able
to sink an enemy ship?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: How was the boat sunk?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: By depth charges. Two Canadian frigates sighted the
U-boat and destroyed it through depth charges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Your testimony today
differs in an essential point from the statement you made on the
27th of November. How did you come to make this statement of
the 27th of November?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: I made the statement in defense of my comrades who
were put before a military court in Hamburg and sentenced to
death for the murder of shipwrecked sailors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Your statement begins
by saying that you had received reports that German sailors were
being accused of murder and that you therefore considered it your
duty to depose the following affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What reports had you received, and when?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: At the beginning of the Hamburg proceedings against
Kapitänleutnant Eck and his officers I was a prisoner of war in
Great Britain; there I heard on the radio and read in newspapers
that these officers were to be tried. Since I knew one of the
accused officers, Leutnant August Hoffmann, very well and had
spoken with him on this subject on two or three occasions, I considered
it to be my duty to come to his assistance and to his defense.
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Were you not told in
your interrogation on the 27th of November that the death sentence
against Eck and Hoffmann had already been confirmed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: That—I don’t remember whether it was on the 27th of
November, I only remember that I was told here that the death
sentence had been carried out. I no longer remember the date, as
I was interrogated several times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Since you have knowledge
of the circumstances, do you maintain that the speech of
Grossadmiral Dönitz mentioned in any way that fire should be
opened on shipwrecked sailors?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: No; we gathered that from his words; and from his
reference to the bombing war, we gathered that total war had now
to be waged against ships and crews. That is what we understood,
and I talked about it to my comrades on the way back to the Hansa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Speak slowly, please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: We were convinced that Admiral Dönitz meant that.
He did not express it clearly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Did you speak about
this point with any of your superiors at the school?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: I left the school on the same day. But I can remember
that one of my superiors, whose name to my regret I do not
recall—nor do I recall the occasion—once spoke to us about this
subject and advised us that, if possible, only officers should be on
the bridge ready to annihilate shipwrecked sailors, should the
possibility arise, or should it be necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: One of your superiors
told you that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: Yes, but I cannot remember in which connection and
where. I received a lot of advice from my superiors on many
things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Was it at the school?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: No; I left the U-boat Training Division on the same
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Were you instructed at
the school in the standing orders of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: Yes; we were instructed in the standing orders of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Did these standing orders
mention anywhere that shipwrecked sailors were to be fired
on or their rescue apparatus destroyed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: The standing orders did not mention that. But—I think
one can assume this from an innuendo of Captain Rollmann, who
was then officers’ company commander—a short time before that,
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
some teletype message had arrived containing an order prohibiting
rescue measures and demanding that sea warfare should be fought
with more radical, more drastic means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Do you think that the
prohibition of rescue measures is identical with the shooting of
shipwrecked sailors?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: We came to this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Please, answer my question.
Do you think these two things are identical?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HEISIG: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Thoma, I am afraid the Tribunal will
have to adjourn now; and I have an announcement to make. You
may cross-examine tomorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: As I have already said, the Tribunal will
not sit in open session this afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The announcement that I have to make is in connection with
the organizations which are alleged to be criminal under Article 9
of the Charter, and this is the announcement:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal has been giving careful consideration to the duty
imposed upon it by Article 9 of the Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is difficult to determine the manner in which the representatives
of the named organizations shall be permitted to appear in
accordance with Article 9, without considering the exact nature of
the case presented for the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this reason, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that, at
this stage of the Trial, with many thousands of applications being
made, the case for the Prosecution should be defined with more
precision than appears in the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these circumstances, therefore, it is the intention of the
Tribunal to invite argument from the Counsel for the Prosecution
and for the Defense, at the conclusion of the case by all prosecutors,
in regard to the questions hereinafter set forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The questions which need further consideration are as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. The Charter does not define a criminal organization, and it is
therefore necessary to examine the tests of criminality which must
be applied and to decide the nature of the evidence to be admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many of the applicants who have made requests to be heard
assert that they were conscripted into the organization, or that
they were ignorant of the criminal purposes of the organization,
or that they were innocent of any unlawful acts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be necessary to decide whether such evidence ought to
be received to rebut the charge of the criminal character of the
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>
organization, or whether such evidence ought more properly to be
received at the subsequent trials under Article 10 of the Charter,
when the organizations have been declared criminal, if the Tribunal
so decides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. The question of the precise time within which the named
organization is said to have been criminal is vital to the decision
of the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal desires to know from the Prosecution at this
stage whether it is intended to adhere to the limits of time set
out in the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. The Tribunal desires to know whether, in the light of the
evidence, any class of persons included within the named organizations
should be excluded from the scope of the declaration, and
which, if any.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the indictment of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party,
the Prosecution have reserved the right to request that Politische
Leiter of subordinate grades or ranks, or of other types or classes,
be exempted from further proceedings without prejudice to other
proceedings or actions against them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is it the intention of the Prosecution to make any such request?
If so, it should be done now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. The Tribunal would be glad if the Prosecution would also:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(a) Summarize in respect of each named organization the
elements which in their opinion justify the charge of being a
criminal organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(b) Indicate what acts on the part of individual defendants,
indicted in this Trial—in the sense used in Article 9 of the
Charter—justify declaring the groups or organizations of which
they are members to be criminal organizations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(c) Submit in writing a summary of proposed findings of fact
as to each organization, with respect to which a finding of criminality
is asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal hopes it is not necessary to say to the Prosecution
that it is not seeking to interfere with the undoubted
right of the Prosecution to present its case in its own way, in the
light of the full knowledge of all the documents and facts which
it possesses, but the duty of the Tribunal under Article 9 of the
Charter makes it essential at this time to have the case clearly
and precisely defined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This announcement will be communicated to the Chief Prosecutors
and to Defense Counsel in writing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will adjourn until 10 o’clock tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, this is my affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: I put that document in, which is 382-PS,
and it becomes Exhibit GB-202.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] In the autumn of 1942 were you head
of the 5th U-boat Flotilla?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Were you stationed at Kiel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: How long did you hold that appointment
altogether?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: For 4 years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Was that from June 1941 until the capitulation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: What were your duties as commander of
that flotilla?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: My main duties as Flotilla Commander consisted of
the fitting out of U-boats which were to be sent to the front from
home bases, and giving them the orders of the U-boat command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Had you any special responsibility to
U-boat commanders in respect of the orders?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE? Yes, Sir; it was my responsibility to see that outgoing
U-boats were provided with the new orders of the U-boat
command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Had you any responsibility in explaining
the orders?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: The orders of the U-boat command were always very
clear and unambiguous. If there were any ambiguities I used to
have these ambiguities cleared up myself at the Staff of the
Commander-in-Chief of U-boats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Did you personally see commanders before
they went out on patrol?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, each commander before leaving for an operational
cruise went through a so-called commander’s briefing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: I will go back, if I may, for two or three
questions. Did you personally see commanders before they went
out on patrol?
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, each commander before sailing on a mission
went through a briefing session at my office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: And what did that briefing session consist
of? Were there any questions on the orders?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, Sir, all experiences of previous patrols and any
questions of the ship’s equipment were discussed with the commander
at that session. Also, the commanders had an opportunity
at the briefing to clarify any uncertainties, which might have existed
in their minds, by asking questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Apart from your briefing sessions, did
commanders also go to Admiral Dönitz’ headquarters for briefing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: As far as that was possible it was done, especially
from the moment when the Commander-in-Chief of U-boats had
transferred his office from Paris to Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Do you remember an order in the autumn
of 1942 dealing with lifeboats?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes. In September 1942 I received a wireless message
addressed to all commanders at sea, and it dealt with that question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: I show you this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, that is the exhibit I have already put in as GB-199.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What other number has it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: It is Document D-630.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Is that the order you are referring to?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, that is the order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: From the time when you were captured
until last Friday had you seen that order?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: It follows, I think, that the account of the
order in your statement was given from recollection?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, only from recollection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Now, after you got that order did you go
to Admiral Dönitz’ headquarters?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, at my first visit to headquarters after receipt
of the order, I personally discussed it with Lieutenant Commander
Kuppisch who was a specialist on the staff of the U-boat command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Will you tell the Tribunal what was said
at that meeting?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: At that meeting I asked Lieutenant Commander
Kuppisch how the ambiguity contained in that order—or I might
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
say, lack of clarity—should be understood. He explained the order
by two illustrations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first example was that of a U-boat in the outer Bay of
Biscay. It was sailing on patrol when it sighted a rubber dinghy
carrying survivors of a British plane. The fact that it was on an
outgoing mission, that is, being fully equipped, made it impossible
to take the crew of the plane on board, although, especially at that
time, it appeared especially desirable to bring back specialists in
navigation from shot-down aircraft crews to get useful information
from them. The commander of the U-boat made a wide circle
around this rubber boat and continued on his mission. When
he returned from his mission he reported this case to the staff of
the Commander-in-Chief of U-boats. The staff officers reproached
him, saying that, if he were unable to bring these navigation
specialists back with him, the right thing to do would have been
to attack that crew, for it was to be expected that, in less than
24 hours at the latest, the dinghy would be rescued by British
reconnaissance forces, and they.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: I don’t quite get what you said would
have been the correct action to take. You were saying the correct
thing to do would have been.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: The right thing to do would have been to attack
the air crew as it was not possible to bring back the crew or
these specialists, for it could be expected that that crew would be
found and rescued within a short time by British reconnaissance
forces, and in given circumstances might again destroy one or two
German U-boats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second example.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Did he give you any second example?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, the second example I am going to recount now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Example 2. During the first month of the U-boat warfare
against the United States a great quantity of tonnage—I do not
recollect the exact figure—had been sunk in the shallow waters off
the American coast. In these sinkings the greater part of the
crews were rescued, because of the close proximity of land. That
was exceedingly regrettable, as to merchant shipping not only
tonnage but also crews belong, and in the meantime these crews
were again able to man newly-built ships.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: You have told us about the ambiguity of
the order. Are you familiar with the way Admiral Dönitz worded
his orders?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: I do not quite understand the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Are you familiar with the way Admiral
Dönitz normally worded his orders?
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes. In my opinion, the order need only have read
like this: It is pointed out anew that rescue measures have to be
discontinued for reasons of safety for the submarines. This is how,
I think, the order should have been worded—if only rescue
measures had been forbidden. All.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Are you saying that if it had been intended
only to prohibit rescue measures it would have been sufficient to
refer to the previous order?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, Sir; that would have been enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Was that previous order also marked
“top secret”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: I do not remember that exactly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: What was the propaganda at the time with
regard to crews?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: The propaganda at that time was to the effect that
the enemy was having great difficulty in finding sufficient crews
for his merchant marine and.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The question as to the propaganda at that
time is too general a question for him to answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: If Your Honor pleases, I don’t press it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] From your knowledge of the way
orders were worded, can you tell the Tribunal what you understood
this order to mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: The order meant, in my own opinion, that although
rescue measures remained prohibited, on the other hand it was
desirable in the case of sinkings of merchantmen that there should
be no survivors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: And was it because you understood this
to be the meaning that you went to Admiral Dönitz’ headquarters?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: I did not go to the headquarters of the U-boat command
on account of this order alone; these visits took place at
frequent intervals in order to discuss other questions also and to
have the opportunity of keeping constantly in touch with the
views and opinions of the U-boat command, as I had to transmit
them to the commanders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: How did you brief commanders on this
order?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: At these briefing sessions I read the wording of the
wireless message to the commanders without making any comment.
In a very few instances some commanders asked me about the
meaning of the order. In such cases I gave them the two examples
that headquarters had given to me. However, I added, “U-boat
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
command cannot give you such an order officially; everybody has
to handle this according to his own conscience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Do you remember an order about rescue
ships?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Can you say what the date of that order
was?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: I do not remember the exact date, but I think it must
have been about the same as the order of September 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: May the witness see the Document D-663
which I put in yesterday?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: It is the German copy of the document
that I am showing him; the original is being held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Document D-663 was submitted to the witness.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, Sir; I recognize that order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: You will note that the date on that document
is the 7th of October 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, this order is laid down there in the general
Operational Order Atlantic Number 56. According to my recollection,
this order was already contained in the previous effective
Operational Order Number 54, that is in a wireless message containing
practical experiences and instructions. I cannot remember
exactly. The date is October 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Phillimore, is that order in the
index here?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Yes, My Lord, that is the Document D-663,
which I put in yesterday as Exhibit GB-200. If it is omitted from
the index, Your Lordship will remember it is the document which,
as I explained yesterday, we just received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Where does it come in?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: It comes in after D-630.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Oh yes. Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Your Lordship will remember the order; it
deals with rescue ships attached to convoys, and it was on the last
sentence that I relied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I only wanted to get the words of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Yes, Sir. My Lord, also I have the original
here now and if it is thought necessary the witness can see it, but
he has seen a copy.
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Do you remember an order about
entries in logs?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, Sir. At the time, the exact date I do not
remember, it had been ordered that sinkings and other acts which
were in contradiction to international conventions should not be
entered in the log but should be reported orally after return to
the home port.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Would you care to say why it is that you
are giving evidence in this case?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, Sir; because when I was taken prisoner it was
claimed that I was the author of these orders, and I do not want
to have this charge connected with my name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, the witness is available for
examination by my colleagues and for cross-examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any counsel for any defendant wish
to ask the witness any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Lieutenant Commander
Moehle, since when have you been in the U-boat arm?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Since the end of 1936.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Do you know Grossadmiral
Dönitz personally?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Since when?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Since October 1937.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Do you see him here in
this room?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Where?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: To the left in the rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Do you know Grossadmiral
Dönitz as an admiral to whom none of his flotilla chiefs
and commanders could speak?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Or was the opposite the
case?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: He could be approached by everybody at any time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Have you yourself been
a commander of a U-boat?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, on nine operations.
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: For how long?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: From the beginning of the war until April 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: How many ships did
you sink?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Twenty ships.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: After sinking ships, did
you destroy the rescue equipment or fire at the survivors?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Did you have an order
to do that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Had the danger passed
for a U-boat after the attack on a merchantman?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No; the danger to the U-boat does not end when
the attack is over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Why not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Because in most instances when a ship is sunk, the
ship is in a position to send SOS messages and give its position,
and thus bring striking forces to attack the U-boat at the last
minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Is there a maxim in the
U-boat arm that fighting comes before rescuing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: I never heard of that rule put in that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Prior to the order of
September 1942 did you know of any other orders by which rescue
work was prohibited if it entailed danger to the U-boat?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, but I do not know when and where this order
was laid down. It had been ordered that, as a matter of principle,
the safety of one’s own boat takes precedence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Was this ordered only
once, or in several instances?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: That I cannot say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Do you know that the
order of September 1942 was given in consequence of an incident
in which German U-boats, contrary to orders, had undertaken rescue
measures?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: And the U-boats were
then attacked by Allied aircraft?
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: A minute ago you classified
the order of September 1942 as ambiguous, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: You interpreted it to the
commanders in the sense that the order should include the destruction
of rescue facilities and of the shipwrecked crew?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No, not quite; I gave the two examples to the commanders
only if they made an inquiry and I passed them on in
the same way as I had received them from the Commander-in-Chief
Submarine Fleet and they themselves could draw that conclusion
from these two examples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: In which sentence of the
order do you see a hidden invitation to kill survivors or to destroy
the rescue facilities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: In the sentence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Just a second, I shall
read to you each sentence of the order separately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: I read from the Document
D-630:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. No attempt of any kind must be made at rescuing members
of ships sunk, and this includes picking up persons in the
water and putting them in lifeboats, righting capsized
lifeboats, and handing over food and water. These are absolutely
forbidden.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Do you see it in this sentence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: “Rescue measures contradict
the most primitive demands of warfare that crews
and ships should be destroyed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Do you see that in this sentence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Does that sentence contain
anything as to the destruction of shipwrecked persons?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No, of crews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: At the end of the order
is the phrase “Be harsh.” Did you hear that phrase there for the
first time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No.
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Was this phrase used by
Commander-in-Chief of U-boats to get the commanders to be
severe themselves and to their crews?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Did you discuss the
order with Lieutenant Commander Kuppisch?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Do you remember that
exactly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: As far as I can rely upon my recollection after
such a long time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Where did that conversation
take place?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: At the staff headquarters of the U-boat command,
probably in Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: What position did Lieutenant
Commander Kuppisch occupy at the time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: As far as I can remember, he was the man in charge
of the Enemy Convoys Department, but I could not say that with
any certainty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Was the superior officer
of Lieutenant Commander Kuppisch, Commander Hessler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Superior officer? I would not say so, because Commander
Hessler was on the same level as Kuppisch, a departmental
chief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Was Lieutenant Commander
Kuppisch’s superior Admiral Goth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, in his capacity of Chief of Staff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Did you speak to Commander
Hessler or Admiral Goth or with the Grossadmiral himself
with regard to the interpretation to be given to the order of
September?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Whether I spoke to Commander Hessler, I do not
remember, but in any case not to Admiral Goth or the Grossadmiral
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: You said Lieutenant
Commander Kuppisch had told you about the opinion which was
prevalent in the staff of the U-boat command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: With regard to the attitude
towards the aviators in the Bay of Biscay, did he tell you
that it was the opinion of the Grossadmiral himself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: I do not remember that. It is too far back. When
explanations were given at staff meetings of the U-boat command
and an opinion was expressed by a responsible departmental chief,
we flotilla leaders naturally took this to be the official opinion of
the Commander-in-Chief of the U-boat arm. Admiral Goth personally
or the Commander-in-Chief of the U-boat arm was only
approached in cases where the departmental chiefs refused to
commit themselves definitely or to assume the responsibility for an
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Did you not get to know
that the story of the airmen who had been shot down in the
Bay of Biscay was in actual fact just the opposite.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: I do not understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: I continue: That the commander
was reprimanded because he did not bring home these
flyers even if it meant breaking off his operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No, I do not know that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Did Lieutenant Commander
Kuppisch tell you in connection with that second example you
mentioned, that the shipwrecked or their rescue equipment off the
American coast should have been destroyed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No; he only said it was regrettable that the crews
had been rescued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: And you concluded from
that that it was desired to have the shipwrecked killed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: I did not draw any conclusions at all from that for I
passed on these examples without any commentary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Do you know the standing
orders of the U-boat command?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Do they contain the
guiding principles of U-boat warfare?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Is there any order in
the standing orders directing or advising the killing of shipwrecked
persons or the destruction of rescue facilities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: As far as I know, no.
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: What grade of secrecy
was attached to these standing orders?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: As far as I remember, top secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Do you remember that
in Standing Order 511 the following was ordered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, I read from an order which I shall submit in
evidence later on. I cannot do it now because I have not yet the
original.</p>

20 May 1943; taking on board of officers of sunken ships.</p>
<hr class='tbk309'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. As far as accommodation facilities on board permit,
captains and chief engineers of sunken ships are to be
brought in. The enemy tries to thwart this intention and
has issued the following order: (a) masters are not allowed
to identify themselves when questioned, but should if possible
use sailors selected especially for this purpose; (b) crew has
to state that masters and chief engineers remained on board.</p>
<hr class='tbk310'/>
<p class='noindent'>“If in spite of energetic questioning it is not possible to find
the masters or the chief engineers, then other ships’ officers
should be taken aboard.</p>
<hr class='tbk311'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. Masters and officers of neutral ships, which, according to
Standing Order Number 101, can be sunk (for instance,
Swedish ships outside Göteborg traffic), are not to be brought
in because internment of these officers would violate international
law.</p>
<hr class='tbk312'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. In case ship officers cannot be taken prisoner, other white
members of the crew should be taken along as far as accommodation
facilities and further operations of the craft permit,
for the purpose of interrogation for military and propaganda
purposes.</p>
<hr class='tbk313'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4. In case of the sinking of a single cruising destroyer, corvette,
or escort vessel, try at all costs to take prisoners, if
that can be done without endangering the boat. Interrogation
of the prisoners at transit camps .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can produce valuable
hints as to antisubmarine tactics, devices, and weapons used
by the enemy; the same applies to air crews of shot-down
planes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Do you know that order?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes. The order seems familiar to me.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Standing Order of U-boat Command; 1 June 1944; taking

information regarding enemy tactics, weapons, location

far as possible and without endangering the boat, the utmost
is to be done to take such prisoners.</p>
<hr class='tbk315'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. As prisoners are extremely willing to talk when captured,
interrogate them at once on board. It is of special interest
to know the manner of locating U-boats by aircraft, whether

hand them over to returning boats.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you know that order?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Did you not notice and
try to clarify a contradiction between these orders concerning the
rescue of air crews in every case and the story you passed on
about the destruction of air crews?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No; because in the order of September 1942 it also
says that the order about the bringing in of ships’ captains and
chief engineers remains in force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Did you hear of any
instance where a U-boat brought in captains and chief engineers but
shot the rest of the crew?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Do you consider it at all
possible that such an order can be given—that is, that part of the
crew should be rescued and the rest of the crew should be killed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No, Sir. One cannot make such an order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Did you ever hear of
any case where a U-boat commander, on the basis of your briefings,
destroyed rescue equipment or killed shipwrecked persons?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Was it permitted to attack
neutral vessels outside the fixed blockade zones?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Only in cases where they were not marked as
neutrals according to regulations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Was the Commander of
the U-boat fleet particularly severe in enforcing this order for the
protection of neutral ships?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: As I know of no such cases, I cannot say anything on
that subject.
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Do you know that the
commanders were threatened with court-martial if they did not
obey the orders given for the protection of neutrals?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes; I remember one case which happened in the
Caribbean Sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Do you remember an
order of 1944 directing that neutral ships be stopped and searched?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, it was ordered, but I do not remember the date,
that particular Spanish and Portuguese ships in the North Atlantic
should be stopped and searched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Did you pass on that
order to the commanders?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: As far as I recollect, this order was given in writing
and was contained in one of the official sets of orders. I passed on
orders to commanders only when they were not contained in a set
of orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: In passing that order
on, did you make an addition as to whether that order should be
executed or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, I remember that I said—when that order came
by radio and the commanders did not know of it yet—that they
should be exceedingly careful, when stopping neutrals, as there
was always the danger that also a neutral ship might disclose the
position of the U-boat by radio. Owing to the air superiority of
the enemy in the North Atlantic, it would always be safer or better
not to be compelled to stop these ships.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Had you orders from
the Commander of the U-boat fleet to make this additional remark?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: As far as I remember, one of the departmental chiefs
in the U-boat command—I assume it was Commander Hessler—told
me or took particular care to point out that any stopping of ships,
even neutrals, involved considerable danger to the U-boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Because of the air patrol?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Because of the air patrol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Your attention has been
called to the order concerning the so-called rescue ships.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Do you remember that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Were these “rescue ships”
recognized under international law as hospital ships, with appropriate
markings?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: As far as I know, they were not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: What orders existed that
hospital ships should be protected?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Where these orders were laid down—whether in
writing I do not remember—I only know that the Commander of
the U-boats fleet frequently reminded the commanders of the
absolute inviolability of hospital ships.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Do you know of any
case in which a hospital ship was attacked by a U-boat?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No; I don’t know of such a case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: If the Commander of
the U-boat fleet had been interested in destroying helpless human
beings in violation of international law, the destruction of hospital
ships would have been an excellent means, don’t you think?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Without any doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: I have no further questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any other Defense Counsel wish to
cross-examine this witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>No response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Did you ever save any of the
survivors of the vessels that you torpedoed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: I have not been in a position to do that due to the
military situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): You mean to say it was dangerous
to your boat to do it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Not only that. A great number of the ships which
I sunk were in a convoy or else there was a rough sea, so that it was
impossible to undertake any rescue measures owing to navigation
conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): That is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Phillimore, do you want to re-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, I have about three questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: [<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] When you were
a U-boat commander yourself, what was the order with regard to
rescue?
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: At the beginning of the war we had been told that
the safety of one’s own boat was the decisive thing, and that the
boat should not be endangered by rescue measures. Whether these
orders already existed in writing at the outbreak of the war I do
not remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: When you got this order of the 17th of
September 1942, did you take it merely as prohibiting rescue or
as going further?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: When I received that order I noticed that it was not
entirely clear, as orders of the B. d. U. normally were. One could
see an ambiguity in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: You have not answered my question. Did
you take the order to mean that a U-boat commander should
merely abstain from rescue measures, or as something further?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: I took the order to mean that something further was
implied, only it was not actually ordered but was considered
desirable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: The instance you were given about the
Bay of Biscay, had you any knowledge of the facts of that incident?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: No, the circumstances of that case are not known to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: What were the actual words you used
when you passed that order on to commanders?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: I told the commanders in so many words: We are
now approaching a very delicate and difficult chapter; it is the
question of the treatment of lifeboats. The Commander of the
U-boat fleet issued the following radio message in September
1942—I then read the radio message of September 1942 in full. For
most of those present the chapter was closed; no commander had
any questions to ask. Explanations were not given unless questions
were asked. In some few instances the commanders asked, “How
should this order be interpreted?” Then as a means of interpretation
I gave the two examples which had been related to me at
the U-boat command and added, “Officially such a thing cannot be
ordered; everybody has to reconcile that with his own conscience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Do you remember any comment being
made by commanding officers after you had read the order?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MOEHLE: Yes, Sir. Several commanders, following the reading
of this radio message said, without making any further comment,
“That is very clear, but damned hard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, I have no further questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>
<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, I would now put before the
Tribunal two cases where that order of the 17th of September 1942
was apparently put into effect. The first case is set out at the next
document in the document book, which is D-645. My Lord, I put
that document in and it becomes Exhibit GB-203. It is a report
of the sinking of a steam trawler, a fishing trawler, the <span class='it'>Noreen
Mary</span>, which was sunk by <span class='it'>U-247</span> on the 5th of July 1944. The first
page of the document contains an extract from the log of the
U-boat. The time reference 1943 on the document is followed by an
account of the firing of two torpedoes which missed, and then, at
2055 hours, the log reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Surfaced. Fishing Vessels.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”—bearings given of three
ships—“Engaged the nearest. She stops after 3 minutes.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then there is an account of a shot fired as the trawler lay stopped,
and then, the final entry:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Sunk by flak, with shots into her side. Sank by the stern.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Tribunal will notice there is no mention in the log of any
action against the torpedoed or the shipwrecked seamen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Why is it entered as 5. 7. 1943?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: It is a typing error. I should have pointed
it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next page of the document is a comment on the
action by the U-boat command, and the last line reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Recognized success: Fishing vessel <span class='it'>Noreen Mary</span> sunk by
flak.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then there is an affidavit by James MacAlister, who was a
deckhand on board the <span class='it'>Noreen Mary</span> at the time of the sinking.
My Lord, reading the last paragraph on the first page of the
affidavit. He has dealt earlier with having seen the torpedo tracks,
which missed the trawler. The last paragraph reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At 2110 hours, while we were still trawling, the submarine
surfaced on our starboard beam, about 50 yards to the
northeast of us, and without any warning immediately
opened fire on the ship with a machine gun. We were 18
miles west from Cape Wrath, on a northwesterly course,
making 3 knots. The weather was fine and clear, sunny, with
good visibility. The sea was smooth, with light airs.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, then there is an account of the firing in the next,
paragraph, and then, if I might read from the second paragraph,
on Page 2.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Why not read the first?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: If Your Lordship pleases:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“When the submarine surfaced I saw men climbing out of the
conning tower. The skipper thought at first the submarine
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>
was British, but when she opened fire he immediately
slackened the brake to take the weight off gear”—that is, the
trawl—“and increased to full speed, which was about 10
knots. The submarine chased us, firing her machine gun,
and with the first rounds killed two or three men, including
the skipper, who were on deck and had not had time to take
cover. The submarine then started using a heavier gun from
her conning tower, the first shot from which burst the boiler,
enveloping everything in steam and stopping the ship.</p>
<hr class='tbk316'/>
<p class='noindent'>“By now the crew had taken cover, but in spite of this all
but four were killed. The submarine then commenced to
circle round ahead of the vessel, and passed down her port
side with both guns firing continuously. We were listing
slowly to port all the time but did not catch fire.</p>
<hr class='tbk317'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The mate and I attempted to release the lifeboat, which was
aft, but the mate was killed whilst doing so, so I abandoned
the attempt. I then went below into the pantry, which was
below the waterline, for shelter. The ship was listing more
and more port, until finally at 2210 she rolled right over and
sank, and the only four men left alive on board were thrown
into the sea. I do not know where the other three men had
taken cover during this time, as I did not hear or see them
until they were in the water.</p>
<hr class='tbk318'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I swam around until I came across the broken bow of our
lifeboat which was upside down, and managed to scramble
on top of it. Even now the submarine did not submerge, but
deliberately steamed in my direction and when only 60 to
70 yards away fired directly at me with a short burst from
the machine gun. As their intention was quite obvious, I fell
into the water and remained there until the submarine
ceased firing and submerged, after which I climbed back on
to the bottom of the boat. The submarine had been firing
her guns for a full hour.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, then the affidavit goes on to describe the deponent
and others attempting to rescue themselves and to help each other,
and then they were picked up by another trawler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last paragraph on that page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Whilst on board the <span class='it'>Lady Madeleine</span> the second engineer
and I had our wounds dressed. I learned later that the
second engineer had 48 shrapnel wounds, also a piece of steel
wire 2½ inches long embedded in his body.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And there is a sentence on which I don’t rely, and the last
sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I had 14 shrapnel wounds.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, and then the last two paragraphs of the affidavit:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This is my fourth wartime experience, having served in the
whalers <span class='it'>Sylvester</span> (mined) and <span class='it'>New Seville</span> (torpedoed), and
the trawler <span class='it'>Ocean Tide</span>, which ran ashore.</p>
<hr class='tbk319'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As a result of this attack by U-boat, the casualties were six
killed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two missing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two injured.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next document, D-647, I put in as Exhibit GB-204.
My Lord, this is an extract from a statement given by the second
officer of the ship <span class='it'>Antonico</span>, torpedoed, set afire, and sunk, on the
28th of September 1942, on the coast of French Guiana. The Tribunal
will observe that the date of the incident is some 11 days after
the issue of the order. My Lord, I would read from the words
“that the witness saw the dead,” slightly more than halfway down
on the first page. An account has been given of the attack on the
ship, which by then was on fire:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that the witness saw the dead on the deck of the
<span class='it'>Antonico</span> as he and his crew tried to swing out their lifeboat;
that the attack was fulminant, lasting almost 20 minutes;
and that the witness already in the lifeboat tried to get away
from the side of the <span class='it'>Antonico</span> in order to avoid being dragged
down by the same <span class='it'>Antonico</span> and also because she was the
aggressor’s target; that the night was dark, and it was thus
difficult to see the submarine, but that the fire aboard the
<span class='it'>Antonico</span> lit up the locality in which she was submerging,
facilitating the enemy to see the two lifeboats trying to get
away; that the enemy ruthlessly machine-gunned the defenseless
sailors in Number 2 lifeboat, in which the witness found
himself, and killed the Second Pilot Arnaldo de Andrade de
Lima, and wounded three of the crew; that the witness gave
orders to his company to throw themselves overboard to
save themselves from the bullets: in so doing, they were
protected and out of sight behind the lifeboat, which was
already filled with water; even so the lifeboat continued to
be attacked. At that time the witness and his companions
were about 20 meters in distance from the submarine.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I haven’t got the U-boat’s log in that case, but you
may think that, in view of the order with regard to entries in logs,
namely that anything compromising should not be put in, it would
be no more helpful than in the case of the previous incident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next Document, D-646(a), I put in as Exhibit
GB-205. It is a monitored account of a talk by a German naval
war reporter on the long wave propaganda service from Friesland.
The broadcast was in English, and the date is the 11th of March
1943. It is, if I may quote:
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Santa Lucia, in the West Indies, was an ideal setting for
romance, but nowadays it was dangerous to sail in these
waters—dangerous for the British and Americans and for all
the colored people who were at their beck and call. Recently
a U-boat operating in these waters sighted an enemy windjammer.
Streams of tracer bullets were poured into the
sails and most of the Negro crew leaped overboard. Knowing
that this might be a decoy ship, the submarine steamed
close, within 20 yards, when hand grenades were hurled into
the rigging. The remainder of the Negroes then leaped into
the sea. The windjammer sank. There remained only
wreckage, lifeboats packed with men, and sailors swimming.
The sharks in the distance licked their teeth in expectation.
Such was the fate of those who sailed for Britain and
America.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next page of the document I don’t propose to read.
It is an extract from the log of the U-boat believed to have sunk
this ship. It was, in fact, the <span class='it'>C. S. Flight</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I read that because, in my submission, it shows that it
was the policy of the enemy at the start to seek to terrorize crews,
and it is a part with the order with regard to rescue ships and
with the order on the destruction of seamen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I might say so, in view of the cross-examination, the Prosecution
do not complain of rescue ships being attacked. They are
not entitled to protection. The point of the order was that they
were to be given priority in attack, and the order, therefore, is
closely allied with the order of the 17th of September 1942. In
view of the Allied building program, it had become imperative
to prevent the ships being manned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I pass to the period after the defendant had succeeded
the Defendant Raeder. My Lord, the next document is 2098-PS.
It has been referred to but not, I think, put in. I put it in formally
as Exhibit GB-206. My Lord, I won’t read it. It merely sets out
that the Defendant Raeder should have the equivalent rank of a
minister of the Reich, and I ask the Tribunal to infer that on
succeeding Raeder the Defendant Dönitz would presumably have
succeeded to that right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This is from 1938 onward?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: From 1938 onward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document, D-648, I put in as Exhibit GB-207. It is an
affidavit by an official, or rather it is an official report certified by
an official of the British Admiralty. The certificate is on the last
page, and it sets out the number of meetings, the dates of the
meetings and those present, on the occasion of meetings between
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>
the Defendant Dönitz or his representative with Hitler from the
time that he succeeded Raeder until the end. The certificate states:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have compiled from them”—that is, from captured
documents—“the attached list of occasions on which Admiral
Dönitz attended conferences at Hitler’s headquarters. The
list of other senior officials who attended the same conferences
is added when this information was contained in the captured
documents concerned. I certify that the list is a true extract
from the collective documents which I have examined, and
which are in the possession of the British Admiralty, London.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I won’t go through the list. I would merely call the
Tribunal’s attention to the fact that either Admiral Dönitz or his
deputy, Konteradmiral Voss, was present at each of these meetings;
and that amongst those who were also constantly there were the
Defendants Speer, Keitel, Jodl, Ribbentrop, and Göring, and also
Himmler or his lieutenants, Fegelein or Kaltenbrunner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the inference which I ask the Tribunal to draw from
the document is that from the time that he succeeded Raeder, this
defendant was one of the rulers of the Reich and was undoubtedly
aware of all decisions, major decisions of policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I pass to the next document, C-178. That has already
been put in as Exhibit Number USA-544. It is an internal memorandum
of the naval war staff, written by the division dealing
with international law to another division, and the subject is the
order with regard to the shooting of Commandos, of the 18th of
October 1942, with which the Tribunal are, I think, familiar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The point of the document is that some doubt appeared to have
arisen in some quarters with regard to the understanding of the
order, and in the last sentence of the memorandum it is suggested:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As far as the Navy is concerned, it remains to be seen
whether or not this case should be used to make sure, after
a conference with the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, that
all departments concerned have an entirely clear conception
regarding the treatment of members of Commando units.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, whether that conference took place or not I do not
know. The document is dated some 11 days after this defendant
had taken over from the Defendant Raeder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the next document in the book, D-649, which I put in as
Exhibit GB-208, is an instance of the Navy in July of that year—July
1943—handing over to the SD for shooting Norwegian and
British naval personnel whom the Navy decided came under the
terms of the order. My Lord, it is an affidavit by a British barrister-at-law
who served as judge advocate at the trial of the members
of the SD who executed the order.
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 1 sets out that the deponent was judge advocate at
the trial of 10 members of the SD by a military court held at the
law courts, Oslo, Norway, which sat on Thursday, 29 November 1945,
and concluded its sitting on Tuesday, 4 December 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next paragraph sets out who convened the court
and the names of the prosecuting and defending counsel, and the
third paragraph states:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The accused were charged with committing a war crime, in
that they at Ulven, Norway, in or about the month of July
1943, in violation of the laws and usages of war, were concerned
in the killing of.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then there follow the names of six personnel of the Norwegian
Navy, including one officer, and one leading telegraphist of the
Royal Navy, prisoners of war. I might read from Paragraph 4:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“There was evidence before the court which was not challenged
by the Defense that Motor Torpedo Boat Number 345 set
out from Lerwick in the Shetlands on a naval operation for
the purpose of making torpedo attacks on German shipping
off the Norwegian coast, and for the purpose of laying mines
in the same area. The persons mentioned in the charge were
all the crew of the torpedo boat.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 5:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Defense did not challenge that each member of the crew
was wearing uniform at the time of capture, and there was
abundant evidence from many persons, several of whom were
German, that they were wearing uniform at all times after
their capture.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 6:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On 27th July 1943, the torpedo boat reached the island of
Aspo off the Norwegian coast, north of Bergen. On the following
day the whole of the crew were captured and were
taken on board a German naval vessel which was under the
command of Admiral Von Schrader, the admiral of the west
coast. The crew were taken to the Bergenhus where they had
arrived by 11 p. m. on 28th July. The crew were there interrogated
by Lieutenant H. P. K. W. Fanger, a naval lieutenant
of the Reserve, on the orders of Korvettenkapitän Egon Drascher,
both of the German Naval Intelligence Service. This
interrogation was carried out upon the orders of the staff of
the admiral of the west coast. Lieutenant Fanger reported to
the officer in charge of the intelligence branch at Bergen that
in his opinion all the members of the crew were entitled
to be treated as prisoners of war, and that officer in turn
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>
reported both orally and in writing to the Sea Commander
Bergen, and in writing to the admiral of the west coast.</p>
<hr class='tbk320'/>
<p class='noindent'>“7. The interrogation by the naval intelligence branch was
concluded in the early hours of 29th July, and almost immediately
all the members of the crew were handed over on the
immediate orders of the Sea Commander Bergen, to Obersturmbannführer
of the SD Hans Wilhelm Blomberg, who
was at that time Kommandeur of the Sicherheitspolizei at
Bergen. This followed a meeting between Blomberg and
Admiral Von Schrader, at which a copy of the Führer Order
of 18 October 1942 was shown to Blomberg. This order dealt
with the classes of persons who were to be excluded from
the protection of the Geneva Convention and were not to
be treated as prisoners of war, but when captured were to
be handed over to the SD. Admiral Von Schrader told Blomberg
that the crew of this torpedo boat were to be handed
over, in accordance with the Führer Order, to the SD.</p>
<hr class='tbk321'/>
<p class='noindent'>“9. The SD then conducted their own interrogation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You can summarize the rest, can’t you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: If Your Lordship pleases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, Paragraph 9 described the interrogation by officials of
the SD, and that these officials took the same views as the naval
intelligence officers, that the crew were entitled to be treated as
prisoners of war; that despite this they were taken out and shot
by an execution squad composed of members of the SD. Then there
is a description of the disposal of the bodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the last paragraph is perhaps important in connection
with the case against the Defendant Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, read it.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: “11. It appeared from the evidence that
in March or April, 1945, an order from the Führer headquarters,
signed by Keitel, was transmitted to the German
authorities in Norway. The substance of the order was that
members of the crew of Commando raids who fell into German
captivity were from that date to be treated as ordinary
prisoners of war. This order referred specifically to the Führer
Order referred to above.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The member of the Tribunal will of course have noted the date; it
was time to put their affairs in order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next document, C-158, I put in as Exhibit GB-209.
It consists of two extracts from minutes of conferences on the 19th
and 20th of February 1945, conferences between the Defendant
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>
Dönitz and Hitler. If I might read the first and last sentence from
the first paragraph of the first extract:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Führer is considering whether or not Germany should
renounce the Geneva Convention.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That is of course the 1929 prisoners-of-war convention. And the
last sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Führer orders the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy to
consider the pros and cons of this step and to state his opinion
as soon as possible.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then the second extract—the Defendant Dönitz states his opinion
in the presence of the Defendant Jodl and the representative of the
Defendant Ribbentrop. It is the last two sentences on which I rely:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On the contrary, the disadvantages”—that is, the disadvantages
of renouncing the convention—“outweigh the
advantages. Even from a general standpoint it appears to the
Commander-in-Chief that this measure would bring no
advantage. It would be better to carry out the measures
considered necessary without warning, and at all costs to
save face with the outer world.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it is no small matter, that document, when one reflects
that it was to that convention that we owe the fact that upwards
of 165,000 British and 65,000 to 70,000 American prisoners of war
were duly recovered at the end of the war. And to advocate
breaching that convention, preferably without saying so, is not a
matter to be treated lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next document, C-171; I put in as Exhibit GB-210.
It is another extract from the minutes of a meeting between the
Defendant Dönitz and Hitler, on the 1st of July 1944. The extract
is signed by the defendant:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Regarding the general strike in Copenhagen, the Führer says
that the only weapon to deal with terror is terror. Court-martial
proceedings create martyrs. History shows that the
names of such men are on everybody’s lips, whereas there is
silence with regard to the many thousands who have lost
their lives in similar circumstances without court-martial
proceedings.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next document, C-195, I put in as Exhibit GB-211.
It is a memorandum signed by the defendant, dated late in 1944.
There is no specific date on the document, but it is late in 1944—in
December, I think, of 1944. The distribution on the third page
includes Hitler, Keitel, Jodl, Speer, and the Supreme Command of
the Air Force.
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, if I might read the second paragraph. He is dealing
with the review of German shipping losses:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Furthermore, I propose reinforcing the shipyard working
parties by prisoners from the concentration camps, and as a
special measure for relieving the present shortage of coppersmiths,
especially in U-boat construction, I propose to divert
coppersmiths from the reduced construction of locomotives
to shipbuilding.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then he goes on to deal with sabotage, and the last two paragraphs
on that page are:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Since, elsewhere, measures for exacting atonement taken
against whole working parties amongst whom sabotage
occurred, have proved successful, and, for example, the
shipyard sabotage in France was completely suppressed,
possibly similar measures for the Scandinavian countries will
come under consideration.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you need to read any more than that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, no. The last sentence of the
document in the next page is Item 2 of the summing-up:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“12,000 concentration camp prisoners will be employed in the
shipyards as additional labor (Security Service agrees to this)”—that
is the SD.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, this man was one of the rulers of Germany, and in
my submission, that document alone is sufficient to condemn him.
It was not for nothing that at these meetings Himmler and his
lieutenants, Fegelein and Kaltenbrunner, were present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, they were not there to discuss U-boats or the use of
battleships. It is clear, in my submission, from this document that
this defendant knew all about concentration camps and concentration
camp labor, and as one of the rulers of Germany he must
bear his full share of that responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I pass to the last document, D-650, which I put in as
Exhibit GB-212.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, this contains the orders issued by the defendant in
April. The document, in my submission, shows the defendant’s
fanatical adherence to the Nazi creed, and his preparedness even
at that stage to continue a hopeless war at the expense of human
life and with the certainty of increased destruction and misery to
the men, women, and children of his country. I read the last paragraph
on the second page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I therefore demand of the commanding officers of the
Navy: .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that they clearly and unambiguously follow the
path of military duty, whatever may happen. I demand of
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>
them that they stamp out ruthlessly all signs and tendencies
among the men which endanger the following of this path.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then he refers to an order.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I demand from senior commanders that they should take
just as ruthless action against any commander who does not
do his military duty. If a commander does not think he has
the moral strength to occupy his position as a leader in this
sense, he must report this immediately. He will then be used
as a soldier in this fateful struggle in some position in which
he is not burdened with any task as a leader.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then the last paragraph on that page, from a further order
of 19th of April, he gives an example of the type of under-officer
who should be promoted.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“An example: In a prison camp of the auxiliary cruiser <span class='it'>Cormoran</span>,
in Australia, a petty officer acting as camp senior
officer, had all communists who made themselves noticeable
among the inmates of the camp systematically done away
with in such a way that the guards did not notice this. This
petty officer is sure of my full recognition for his decision and
his execution. After his return, I shall promote him with all
means, as he has shown that he is fitted to be a leader.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, of course the point is not whether the facts were true
or not, but the type of order that he was issuing. My Lord, if I
might just sum up, the defendant was no plain sailor, playing the
part of a service officer, loyally obedient to the orders of the
government of the day; he was an extreme Nazi who did his
utmost to indoctrinate the Navy and the German people with the
Nazi creed. It is no coincidence that it was he who was chosen to
succeed Hitler; not Göring, not Ribbentrop, not Goebbels, not
Himmler. He played a big part in fashioning the U-boat fleet, one
of the most deadly weapons of aggressive war. He helped to plan
and execute aggressive war, and we cannot doubt that he knew
well that these wars were in deliberate violation of treaties. He
was ready to stoop to any ruse where he thought he would not be
found out: Breaches of the Geneva Convention or of neutrality,
where he might hope to maintain that sinking was due to a mine.
He was ready to order, and did order, the murder of helpless
survivors of sunken ships, an action only paralleled by that of his
Japanese ally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, there can be few countries where widows or parents
do not mourn for men of the merchant navies whose destruction
was due to the callous brutality with which, at the orders of this
man, the German U-boats did their work.
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, my learned friend, Major Elwyn Jones, now deals with
the Defendant Raeder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR F. ELWYN JONES (Junior Counsel for the United
Kingdom): May it please the Tribunal, it is my duty to present to
the Tribunal the evidence against the creator of the Nazi Navy, the
Defendant Raeder. The allegations against him are set out in Appendix
A of the Indictment at Pages 33 and 34 (Volume I, Page 78), and
the Tribunal will see that the Defendant Raeder is charged with
promoting and participating in the planning of the Nazi wars of
aggression; with executing those plans; and with authorizing,
directing, and participating in Nazi War Crimes, particularly war
crimes arising out of sea warfare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the outset the Tribunal may find it convenient to look at
Document 2888-PS, which is already before the Tribunal as Exhibit
Number USA-13, which the Tribunal will find at Page 96 of the
document book. That is a document which sets out the offices and
positions held by the Defendant Raeder. The Tribunal will see that
he was born in 1876 and joined the German Navy in 1894. By 1918
he had become commander of the cruiser <span class='it'>Köln</span>. In 1928 he became
an admiral, chief of naval command, and head of the German Navy.
In 1935 he became Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. In 1936, on
Hitler’s 47th birthday, he became general admiral, a creation of
Hitler’s. In 1937 he received the high Nazi honor of the Golden
Badge of Honor of the Nazi Party. In 1938 he became a member of
the Secret Cabinet Council. And in 1939 he reached the empyrean
of Grossadmiral, a rank created by Hitler, who presented Raeder
with a marshal’s baton. In 1943 he became Admiral Inspector of
the German Navy, which, as the Tribunal will shortly see, was a
kind of retirement into oblivion, because from January 1943 on, as
the Tribunal has heard, Dönitz was the effective commander of the
German Navy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these eventful years of Raeder’s command of the German
Navy from 1928 to 1943 he played a vital role. I would like in the
first instance to draw the Tribunal’s attention to Raeder’s part in
building up the German Navy as an instrument of war to implement
the Nazis’ general plan of aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal is by now familiar with the steps by which the
small navy permitted to Germany under the Treaty of Versailles
was enormously expanded under the guidance of Raeder. I will do
no more than to remind the Tribunal of some of the milestones
upon Raeder’s road to Nazi mastery of the seas, which mercifully
he was unable to attain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to the story of Germany’s secret rearmament in
violation of the Treaty of Versailles, I would refer the Court to the
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>
Document C-156, which is already before the Court as Exhibit
Number USA-41 and which the Tribunal will find at Page 26 of
the document book. That document, as the Tribunal will remember,
was <span class='it'>A History of the Fight of the German Navy against Versailles,
1919 to 1935</span>, which was published secretly by the German Admiralty
in 1937. The Tribunal will remember that that history shows that
before the Nazis came to power the German Admiralty was deceiving
not only the governments of other countries, but its own legislature
and at one stage its own Government. Their secret measures
of rearmament ranged from experimental U-boat and S-boat building
to the creation of secret intelligence and finance organizations.
I only propose to trouble the Tribunal with a reference to the last
paragraph at Page 33 of the document book, which refers to the
role of Raeder in this development. It is an extract from Page 75
of this Document C-156, and it reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Admiral .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Raeder,
had received hereby a far-reaching independence in the
building and development of the Navy. This was only hampered
insofar as the previous concealment of rearmament
had to be continued in consideration of the Versailles Treaty.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As an illustration of Raeder’s concealment of rearmament, I
would remind the Tribunal of the Document C-141, Exhibit Number
USA-47, which is at Page 22 of the document book. In that document
Raeder states that:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In view of Germany’s treaty obligations and the disarmament
conference, steps must be taken to prevent the first S-boat
half-flotilla—which in a few months will comprise new
S-boats of the same type—from appearing openly as a formation
of torpedo-carrying boats, as it was not intended to
count these S-boats against the number of torpedo-carrying
boats allowed us.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next document, C-135, which will be Exhibit Number
GB-213, and which is at Page 20 of the document book, is of unusual
interest because it suggests that even in 1930 the intention ultimately
to attack Poland was already current in German military
circles. This document is an extract from the history of war
organization and of the scheme for mobilization. The German text
of this document is headed “850/38,” which suggests that the document
was written in the year 1938. The extracts read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Since under the Treaty of Versailles all preparations for
mobilization were forbidden, these were at first confined to
a very small body of collaborators and were at first only of a
theoretical nature. Nevertheless, there existed at that time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>
an ‘Assembling Order,’ and ‘Instructions for Assembling,’ the
forerunners of the present-day scheme for mobilization, also
an assembling organization and adaptable instructions for
assembling which were drawn up for each ‘A-year’ (cover-name
for mobilization year).</p>
<hr class='tbk322'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As stated, the ‘Assembling Organization’ at that time was
to be judged purely theoretically, for they had no positive
basis in the form of men and materials. They provided nevertheless
a valuable foundation for the establishment of a war
organization as our ultimate aim.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The crises between Germany and Poland, which were becoming
increasingly acute, compelled us, instead of making
theoretical preparation for war, to prepare in a practical
manner for a purely German-Polish conflict.</p>
<hr class='tbk323'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The strategic idea of a rapid forcing of the Polish base of
Gdynia was made a basis; and the fleet on active service was
to be reinforced by the auxiliary forces which would be indispensable
to attain this strategic end; and the essential coastal
and flak batteries, especially those in Pillau and Swinemünde,
were to be taken over. Thus in 1930 the Reinforcement
Plan was evolved.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>If the Tribunal turns over the page to Paragraph 3, to the second
paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Hitler had made a clear political request to build up for him
in 5 years, that is to say, by the 1st of April 1938, armed
forces which he could place in the balance as an instrument
of political power.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now that entry is a pointer to the fact that the Nazi seizure of
power in 1933 was a signal to Raeder to go full speed ahead on
rearmament. The detailed story of this development has already
been told by my American colleague, Mr. Alderman; and I would
simply refer the Court in the first place to the Document C-189,
Exhibit Number USA-44, which is at Page 66 of the document book.
In that document Raeder tells Hitler, in June 1934, that the German
Fleet must be developed to oppose England and that therefore from
1936 on the big ships must be armed with big guns to match the
British <span class='it'>King George</span> class of battleship. It further, in the last paragraph,
refers to Hitler’s demand that the construction of U-boats
should be kept completely secret, especially in view of the Saar
plebiscite. In November 1934 Raeder had a further talk with Hitler
on the financing of naval rearmament, and on that occasion Hitler
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>
told him that in case of need he would get Doctor Ley to put 120
to 150 million from the Labor Front at the disposal of the Navy.
The reference to that is the Document C-190, Exhibit Number
USA-45, at Page 67 of the document book. The Tribunal may think
that that proposed fraud upon the German working people was a
characteristic Nazi manifestation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would that be a convenient time to break off?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR JONES: If Your Lordship pleases.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR JONES: May it please the Tribunal, the next document
which I desire to draw to the Tribunal’s attention is the Document
C-23, Exhibit Number USA-49, at Page 3 of the document book,
which states that the true displacement of certain German battleships
exceeded by 20 percent the displacement reported to the
British. That, I submit, is typical of Raeder’s use of deceit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document to which I wish to refer briefly is C-166,
Exhibit Number USA-48, Page 36 of the document book. It is
another such deceitful document, which orders that auxiliary
cruisers, which were being secretly constructed, should be referred
to as “transport ships.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there is the Document C-29, Exhibit Number USA-46, at
Page 8 of the document book, which is signed by Raeder and deals
with the support given by the German Navy to the German armament
industry, and, I submit, is an illustration of Raeder’s concern
with the broader aspects of Nazi policy and of the close link
between Nazi politicians, German service chiefs, and German armament
manufacturers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Has that been put in before?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR JONES: That has been put in before, My Lord, as
Exhibit Number USA-46.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A final commentary on the post-1939 naval rearmament is the
Document C-155, at Page 24 of the document book, which is a new
document and will be Exhibit GB-214 and is a letter from Raeder to
the German Navy, dated 11 June 1940. The original, which is now
submitted to the Tribunal, shows the very wide distribution of this
letter. There is provision in the distribution list for 467 copies. This
letter of Raeder’s is a letter both of self-justification and of apology.
The extracts read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The most outstanding of the numerous subjects of discussion
in the Officers Corps are, for the time being, the torpedo
positions and the problem whether the naval building program,
up to autumn 1939, envisaged the possibility of the
outbreak of war as early as 1939, or whether the emphasis
ought not to have been laid, from the first, on the construction
of U-boats.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk324'/>
<p class='noindent'>“If the opinion is voiced in the Officers Corps that the entire
naval building program has been wrongly directed and if,
from the first, the emphasis should have been on the U-boat
weapon and after its consolidation on the large ships, I must
emphasize the following matters:
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk325'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The building up of the fleet was directed according to the
political demands, which were decided by the Führer. The
Führer hoped, until the last moment, to be able to put off the
threatening conflict with England until 1944-45. At that time
the Navy would have had available a fleet with a powerful
U-boat superiority and a much more favorable ratio as regards
strength in all other types of ships, particularly those designed
for warfare on the High Seas.</p>
<hr class='tbk326'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The development of events forced the Navy, contrary to the
expectation even of the Führer, into a war which it had to
accept while still in the initial stage of its rearmament. The
result is that those who represent the opinion that the emphasis
should have been laid from the start on the building of
the U-boat arm appear to be right. I leave undiscussed how
far this development, quite apart from difficulties of personnel,
training, and dockyards, could have been appreciably
improved in any way in view of the political limits of the
Anglo-German Naval Treaty. I leave also undiscussed, how
the early and necessary creation of an effective air force
slowed down the desirable development of the other branches
of the forces. I indicate, however, with pride, the admirable
and, in spite of the political restraints in the years of the
Weimar Republic, far-reaching preparation for U-boat construction,
which made the immensely rapid construction of the
U-boat arm, both as regards equipment and personnel, possible
immediately after the assumption of power.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There is here, the Tribunal sees, no trace of reluctance in co-operating
with the Nazi program. On the contrary, the evidence
points to the fact that Raeder welcomed and became one of the
pillars of Nazi power. And it will now be my purpose to develop
the relationship between Raeder, the Navy, and the Nazi Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution’s submission is that Raeder, more than anyone
else, was responsible for securing the unquestioned allegiance of
the German Navy to the Nazi movement, an allegiance which
Dönitz was to make even more firm and fanatical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raeder’s approval of Hitler was shown particularly clearly on
the 2d of August 1934, the day of Hindenburg’s death, when he
and all the men under him swore a new oath of loyalty with
considerable ceremony, this time to Adolf Hitler and no longer to
the fatherland. The oath is found in the Document D-481 at
Page 101 of the document book. That will be Exhibit GB-215, and
it may be of interest to the Court to see what the new oath was.
The last paragraph reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The service oath of the soldiers of the armed forces:
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk327'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘I swear this holy oath by God that I will implicitly obey
the Leader of the German Reich and people, Adolf Hitler,
the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and that, as
a brave soldier, I will be willing to stake my life at any
time for this oath.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Tribunal will see that for his fatherland Raeder substituted
a Führer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am not proposing to take the Tribunal’s time with reiterating
the steps by which the German Navy was progressively drawn
into the closest alliance with the Nazi Party. I would remind the
Court of facts of history, like the incorporation of the swastika into
the ensign under which the German Fleet sailed and the wearing
of the swastika on the uniform of naval officers and men, which
are facts which speak for themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazis for their part, were not ungrateful for Raeder’s
obeisance and collaboration. His services in rebuilding the German
Navy were widely recognized by Nazi propagandists and by the
Nazi press. On his 66th birthday, the chief Party organ, the
<span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>, published a special article about him, to
which I desire to draw the Tribunal’s attention. It is at Page 100
of the document book; it is Document D-448, Exhibit GB-216. It
is a valuable summing-up of Raeder’s contribution to Nazi
development:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It was to Raeder’s credit”—writes the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>—“to
have already built up by that time a powerful striking
force from the numerically small fleet, despite the fetters of
Versailles.</p>
<hr class='tbk328'/>
<p class='noindent'>“With the assumption of power, National Socialism began the
most fruitful period in the reconstruction of the German
fleet.</p>
<hr class='tbk329'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Führer openly expressed his recognition of Raeder’s
faithful services and unstinted co-operation, by appointing
him Grossadmiral on the 20th of April 1936.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you think it necessary to read the entire
document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR JONES: I was going to turn to the last paragraph but
one, My Lord, which I think is helpful.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As a soldier and a seaman, the Grossadmiral has proved
himself to be the Führer’s first and foremost naval
collaborator.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This, in my submission, is a summing-up of his status and
position in Nazi Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now propose to deal with Raeder’s personal part in the Nazi
conspiracy. The evidence indicates that Raeder, from the time of
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>
the Nazi seizure of power, became increasingly involved in
responsibility for the general policies of the Nazi State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long before he was promoted to General-Admiral in 1936, he
had become a member of the very secret Reich Defense Council,
joining it when it was founded on the 4th of April 1933. And thus,
at an early date, he was involved, both militarily and politically,
in the Nazi conspiracy. The relevant document upon that is Document
EC-177, Exhibit Number USA-390, at Page 68 of the document
book, which I would remind the Tribunal contains the classic Nazi
directive: “Matters communicated orally cannot be proven; they
can be denied by us in Geneva.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 4th of February 1938 Raeder was appointed to be a
member of a newly-formed secret advisory council for foreign
affairs; and the authority for that statement is Document 2031-PS
at Page 88 of the document book, which will be Exhibit GB-217.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three weeks after this a decree of Hitler’s stated that, as well
as being equal in rank with a cabinet minister, Raeder was also
to take part in the sessions of the Cabinet. That has already been
established in Document 2098-PS, which was submitted as Exhibit
GB-206.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In my submission, therefore, it is thus clear that Raeder’s
responsibility for the political decisions of the Nazi State was
steadily developed from 1933 to 1938 and that in the course of time
he had become a member of all the main political advisory bodies.
He was, indeed, very much a member of the inner councils of the
conspirators and, I submit, must carry with them the responsibility
for the acts that led to the German invasion of Poland in 1939
and the outbreak of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As an illustration, I would remind the Tribunal that Raeder
was present at two of the key meetings at which Hitler openly
declared his intention of attacking neighboring countries. I refer
the Tribunal to Document 386-PS, which is Exhibit Number USA-25
and is found at Page 81 of the document book, which the Tribunal
will remember is the record of Hitler’s conference at the Reich
Chancellery on the 5th of November 1937 about matters which
were said to be too important to discuss in the larger circle of
the Reich Cabinet. The document, which Mr. Alderman submitted,
establishes conclusively that the Nazis premeditated their Crimes
against Peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was the other conference of Hitler’s on the 23rd
of May 1939, the minutes of which are found in the Document L-79,
Exhibit Number USA-27, at Page 74 of the document book. That,
the Tribunal will remember, was the conference at which Hitler
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>
confirmed his intention to make a deliberate attack upon Poland
at the first opportunity, well knowing that this must cause widespread
war in Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, those two were key conferences. At many, many others
Raeder was also present to place his knowledge and his professional
skill at the service of the Nazi war machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His active promotion of the military planning and preparation
for the Polish campaign is by now well-known to the Tribunal, and
I am not proposing to reiterate that evidence again. Once the war
did start, however, the Defendant Raeder showed himself to be
a master of the most typical of the conspirators’ techniques, namely
that of deceit on a grand scale. There are few better examples
of this allegation than that of his handling of the case of the
<span class='it'>Athenia</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Athenia</span>, as the Tribunal will be aware, was a passenger liner
which was sunk in the evening of the 3rd of September 1939, when
she was outward bound to America, about a hundred lives
being lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 23rd of October 1939 the Nazi Party paper, the <span class='it'>Völkischer
Beobachter</span>, published in screaming headlines the story, “Churchill
Sank the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>.” I would refer the Court to Document 3260-PS,
at Page 97 of the document book, which will be Exhibit GB-218.
And I would like the Tribunal to look for a moment at the copy
of the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> here, and see the scale with which
this deliberate lie was perpetrated. I have a photostat of the
relevant page of the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> for that day. That is
the third page and the Tribunal will see on this front page, with
the big red underlining, there are the words, “Now We Indict
Churchill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The extract from the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>, which is at Page 97
of the document book, reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Churchill Sank the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>. The above picture”—and the
Tribunal will see it is a fine picture of this fine ship—“shows
the proud <span class='it'>Athenia</span>, the ocean giant, which was sunk by
Churchill’s crime. One can clearly see the big radio equipment
on board the ship. But nowhere was an SOS heard
from the ship. Why was the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> silent? Because her
captain was not allowed to tell the world anything. He very
prudently refrained from telling the world that Winston
Churchill attempted to sink the ship through the explosion
of a time bomb. He knew it well, but he had to keep silent.
Nearly 1,500 people would have lost their lives if Churchill’s
original plan had resulted as the criminal wanted. Yes, he
longingly hoped that the 100 Americans on board the ship
would find death in the waves so that the anger of the
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>
American people, who were deceived by him, should be
directed against Germany, as the presumed author of the
deed. It was fortunate that the majority escaped the fate
intended for them by Churchill. Our picture on the right
shows two wounded passengers. They were rescued by the
freighter <span class='it'>City of Flint</span>, and as can be seen here, turned over
to the American coast guard boat <span class='it'>Gibb</span> for further medical
treatment. They are an unspoken accusation against the
criminal Churchill. Both they and the shades of those who
lost their lives call him before the tribunal of the world
and ask the British people, ‘How long will the office, one of
the richest in tradition known to Great Britain’s history, be
held by a murderer?’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, in view of the maliciousness of this <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>
announcement and in fairness to the men of the British Merchant
Navy, I think it is proper that I should say, that contrary to the
allegation in this Nazi sheet, the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> of course made repeated
wireless distress signals which were in fact intercepted and
answered by His Majesty’s ship <span class='it'>Electra</span>, in escort, as well as by
the Norwegian steamship <span class='it'>Knut Nelson</span> and the yacht <span class='it'>Southern
Cross</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall submit evidence to the Tribunal to establish that, in
fact, the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> was sunk by the German U-boat <span class='it'>U-30</span>. So unjustifiable
was the torpedoing of the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>, however, that the
German Navy embarked upon a course of falsification of their
records and on other dishonest measures, in the hope of hiding this
guilty secret. And for their part, as the Tribunal has seen, the
Nazi propagandists indulged in their favorite falsehood of seeking
to shift the responsibility to the British.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captain of the <span class='it'>U-30</span>, Oberleutnant Lemp, was later killed
in action; but some of the original crew of the <span class='it'>U-30</span> have survived
to tell the tale, and they are now prisoners of war. And so that
the truth of this episode may be placed beyond a peradventure,
I submit to the Tribunal an affidavit by a member of the crew
of the <span class='it'>U-30</span>, as to the sinking of the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> and as to one aspect
of the attempt to conceal the true facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I refer to Document C-654, Exhibit GB-219, at Page 106 of the
document book. The affidavit reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I, Adolf Schmidt, Official Number N 1043-33T, of the
German Navy and former member of the crew of the
<span class='it'>U-30</span>, do solemnly declare that:</p>
<hr class='tbk330'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. I am now confined to Camp No. 133, Lethbridge, Alberta.</p>
<hr class='tbk331'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. That on the first day of war, 3 September 1939, a ship
of approximately 10,000 tons was torpedoed in the late hours
of the evening by the <span class='it'>U-30</span>.
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk332'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. That after the ship was torpedoed and we surfaced
again, approximately half an hour after the explosion, the
commandant called me to the tower in order to show me the
torpedoed ship.</p>
<hr class='tbk333'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4. That I have seen the ship with my very eyes, but that
I do not think that the ship could see our U-boat at that
time on account of the position of the moon.</p>
<hr class='tbk334'/>
<p class='noindent'>“5. That only a few members of the crew had an opportunity
to go to the tower in order to see the torpedoed ship.</p>
<hr class='tbk335'/>
<p class='noindent'>“6. That apart from myself, Oberleutnant Hinsch was in the
tower when I saw the steamer after the attack.</p>
<hr class='tbk336'/>
<p class='noindent'>“7. That I observed that the ship was listing.</p>
<hr class='tbk337'/>
<p class='noindent'>“8. That no warning shot was fired before the torpedo was
launched.</p>
<hr class='tbk338'/>
<p class='noindent'>“9. That I myself observed much commotion on board the
torpedoed ship.</p>
<hr class='tbk339'/>
<p class='noindent'>“10. That I believe that the ship had only one smoke stack.</p>
<hr class='tbk340'/>
<p class='noindent'>“11. That in the attack on this steamer one or two torpedoes
were fired which did not explode but that I myself heard
the explosion of the torpedo which hit the steamer.</p>
<hr class='tbk341'/>
<p class='noindent'>“12. That Oberleutnant Lemp waited until darkness before
surfacing.</p>
<hr class='tbk342'/>
<p class='noindent'>“13. That I was severely wounded by aircraft 14 September
1939.</p>
<hr class='tbk343'/>
<p class='noindent'>“14. That Oberleutnant Lemp, shortly before my disembarkation
in Reykjavik 19 September 1939, visited me in the
forenoon in the petty officers’ quarters where I was lying
severely wounded.</p>
<hr class='tbk344'/>
<p class='noindent'>“15. That Oberleutnant Lemp then had the petty officers’
quarters cleared in order to be alone with me.</p>
<hr class='tbk345'/>
<p class='noindent'>“16. That Oberleutnant Lemp then showed me a declaration
under oath according to which I had to bind myself to
mention nothing concerning the incidents of 3 September
1939 on board the <span class='it'>U-30</span>.</p>
<hr class='tbk346'/>
<p class='noindent'>“17. That this declaration under oath had approximately the
following wording:</p>
<hr class='tbk347'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘I, the undersigned, swear hereby that I shall shroud in
secrecy all happenings of 3 September 1939 on board the
<span class='it'>U-30</span>, regardless whether foe or friend, and that I shall erase
from my memory all happenings of this day.’</p>
<hr class='tbk348'/>
<p class='noindent'>“18. That I have signed this declaration under oath, which
was drawn up by the commandant in his own handwriting,
with my left hand very illegibly.
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk349'/>
<p class='noindent'>“19. That later on in Iceland when I heard about the sinking
of the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> the idea came into my mind that the <span class='it'>U-30</span>
on the 3 September 1939 might have sunk the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>,
especially since the captain caused me to sign the above-mentioned
declaration.</p>
<hr class='tbk350'/>
<p class='noindent'>“20. That up to today I have never spoken to anyone concerning
these events.</p>
<hr class='tbk351'/>
<p class='noindent'>“21. That due to the termination of the war I consider myself
freed from my oath.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dönitz’ part in the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> episode is described in an affidavit
which he has sworn, which is Document D-638, Exhibit GB-220,
at Page 102 of the document book. The affidavit was sworn in
English, and I invite the Tribunal to look at it and observe the
addition in Dönitz’ handwriting of four words at the end of the
affidavit, the significance of which will be seen in a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Dönitz states:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>U-30</span> returned to harbor about mid-September. I met the
captain, Oberleutnant Lemp, on the lockside at Wilhelmshaven,
as the boat was entering harbor, and he asked permission
to speak to me in private. I noticed immediately
that he was looking very unhappy and he told me at once
that he thought he was responsible for the sinking of the
<span class='it'>Athenia</span> in the North Channel area. In accordance with my
previous instructions he had been keeping a sharp lookout
for possible armed merchant cruisers in the approaches to the
British Isles, and had torpedoed a ship he afterwards
identified as the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> from wireless broadcasts, under the
impression that she was an armed merchant cruiser on patrol.
I had never specified in my instructions any particular type
of ship as armed merchant cruiser nor mentioned any names
of ships. I dispatched Lemp at once by air to report to the
SKL at Berlin; in the meantime, I ordered complete secrecy
as a provisional measure. Later in the same day or early
on the following day, I received a verbal order from Kapitän
zur See Fricke”—who was head of the operations division
of the naval war staff—“that:</p>
<hr class='tbk352'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Firstly, the affair was to be kept a total secret.</p>
<hr class='tbk353'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Secondly, the OKM considered that a court-martial was not
necessary as they were satisfied that the captain had acted
in good faith.</p>
<hr class='tbk354'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Thirdly, political explanations would be handled by the
OKM.</p>
<hr class='tbk355'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I had had no part whatsoever in the political events in
which the Führer claimed that no U-boat had sunk the
<span class='it'>Athenia</span>.
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk356'/>
<p class='noindent'>“After Lemp returned to Wilhelmshaven from Berlin, I interrogated
him thoroughly on the sinking and formed the
impression that, although he had taken reasonable care, he
had still not taken sufficient precaution to establish fully the
identity of the ship before attacking. I had previously given
very strict orders that all merchant vessels and neutrals were
to be treated according to naval prize law before the occurrence
of this incident. I accordingly placed him under cabin
arrest, as I felt certain that a court-martial would only acquit
him and would entail unnecessary publicity”—and then
Dönitz had added the words “and loss of time.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is right, I think, that I should add the Dönitz’ suggestion
that the captain of the <span class='it'>U-30</span> sank the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> in mistake for a
merchant cruiser must be considered in the light of a document
which Colonel Phillimore submitted—the Document C-191, Exhibit
GB-193, dated the 22 of September 1939—in this period, which
contained Dönitz’ order that “the sinking of a merchant ship must
be justified in the War Diary as due to possible confusion with a
warship or an auxiliary cruiser.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, the <span class='it'>U-30</span> returned to Wilhelmshaven on 27 September
1939. I submit another fraudulent naval document, Document
D-659, Page 110 of the document book, which will be Exhibit
GB-221, which is an extract from the War Diary of the chief of
U-boats, and it is an extract for the 27th of September 1939. The
Tribunal will see that it reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>U-30</span> comes in. She had sunk: S. S. <span class='it'>Blairlogies</span>; S. S. <span class='it'>Fanad
Head</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There is no reference at all, of course, to the sinking of the
<span class='it'>Athenia</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But perhaps the most elaborate forgery in connection with this
episode was the forgery of the log book of the <span class='it'>U-30</span>, which was
responsible for sinking the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>; and I now submit that original
log book to the Tribunal as Document D-662, which will be Exhibit
GB-222, and an extract from the first and relevant page of it is
found at Page 111 of the document book. I would like the Tribunal
to examine the original, if you will be good enough to do so,
because the Prosecution’s submission is that the first page of that
log book is a forgery, but a forgery which shows a curiously
un-German carelessness about detail. The Tribunal will see that
the first page of the text is a clear substitute for pages that have
been removed. The dates in the first column of that page are in
Arabic numerals. On the second and more authentic looking page,
and throughout the other pages of the log book, they are in Roman
numerals.
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will also see that all reference to the action of
the sinking of the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> on the 3rd of September is omitted. The
entries are translated on Page 111 of the document book for the
Court’s assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The log book shows that the position at 1400 hours, of the <span class='it'>U-30</span>
on the 3rd of September, is given as AL 0278, which the Tribunal
will notice is one of the very few positions quoted at all upon that
page, and which was, in fact, some 200 miles west of the position
where the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> was sunk. The course due south, which is
recorded in the log book, and the speed of 10 knots—those entries
are obviously designed to suggest that the <span class='it'>U-30</span> was well clear of
the <span class='it'>Athenia’s</span> position on the 3rd of September.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, and most curiously, the Tribunal will observe that
Lemp’s own signature upon the page dealing with the 3rd of
September differs from the other signatures in the text. Page 1
shows Lemp’s signature with a Roman “p” as the final letter of
his name. On the other signatures, there is a script “p,” and the
inference I submit is that either the signature is a forgery or it
was made up by Lemp at some other, and probably considerably
later date.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, in my submission, the whole of this <span class='it'>Athenia</span> story
establishes that the German Navy under Raeder embarked upon
deliberate fraud. Even before receiving Lemp’s reports, the
German Admiralty had repeatedly denied the possibility that a
German U-boat could be in the area concerned. The charts which
showed the disposition of U-boats and the position of sinking of
the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>, which Colonel Phillimore introduced, have shown the
utter dishonesty of these announcements; and my submission upon
this matter is this: Raeder, as head of the German Navy, knew all
the facts. Censorship and information control in Nazi Germany
were so complete that Raeder, as head of the Navy, must have been
party to the falsification published in the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>,
which was a wholly dishonorable attempt by the Nazi conspirators
to save their faces with their own people and to uphold the myth
of an infallible Führer backed by an impeccable war machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal has seen that truth mattered little in Nazi propaganda,
and it would appear that Raeder’s camouflage was not
confined to painting his ships or sailing them under the British
flag, as he did in attacking Norway and Denmark. With regard
to that last matter—the invasion of Norway and Denmark—I think
it is hardly necessary that I should remind the Tribunal of
Raeder’s leading part in that perfidious Nazi assault, the evidence
as to which has already been presented. I think I need only add
Raeder’s proud comment upon those brutal invasions, which is
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>
contained in his letter in Document C-155 at Page 25 of the document
book, which is already before the Tribunal as Exhibit GB-214.
That document, which is a letter of Raeder’s to the Navy, part
of which I have already read, states: “The operations of the Navy
in the occupation of Norway will for all time remain the grand
contribution of the Navy to this war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, with the occupation of Norway and of much of Western
Europe safely completed, the Tribunal has seen that Hitler turned
his eyes towards Russia. Now, in fairness to Raeder, it is right
that I should say that Raeder himself was against the attack on
Russia and tried his best to dissuade Hitler from embarking upon
it. The documents show, however, that Raeder approached the
problem with complete cynicism. He did not object to the aggressive
war on Russia because of its illegality, its immorality, its
inhumanity. His only objection to it was its untimeliness. He
wanted to finish England first before going further afield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story of Raeder’s part in the deliberations upon the war
against Russia is told in the Document C-170, at Page 37 of the
document book, which has already been submitted as Exhibit
Number USA-136. That document consists of extracts from a
German compilation of official naval notes by the German naval
war staff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first entry, at Page 47 of the document book, which bore
the date of 26 September 1940, which is at Page 11 of Document
C-170, showed that Raeder was advocating to Hitler an aggressive
Mediterranean policy in which, of course, the Navy would play a
paramount role, as opposed to a continental land policy. The entry
reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Naval Supreme Commander with the Führer. Naval
Supreme Commander presents his opinion about the
situation: The Suez Canal must be captured with German
assistance. From Suez, advance through Palestine and Syria;
then Turkey in our power. The Russian problem will then
assume a different appearance. Russia is fundamentally
frightened of Germany. It is questionable whether action
against Russia from the north will then be still necessary.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next entry at Page 48 of the document book, for the 14th
of November:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Naval Supreme Commander with the Führer. Führer is
‘still inclined’ to instigate the conflict with Russia. Naval
Supreme Commander recommends putting it off until the
time after the victory over England, since there is heavy
strain on German forces and the end of warfare is not in
sight.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then there is the entry on Page 50 for 27 December 1940:
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Naval Supreme Commander with the Führer. Naval Supreme
Commander emphasizes again that strict concentration of our
entire war effort against England as our main enemy is the
most urgent need of the hour. On the one hand, England
has gained strength by the unfortunate Italian conduct of
the war in the eastern Mediterranean and by the increasing
American support. On the other hand, however, she can be
hit mortally by a strangulation of her ocean traffic which is
already taking effect. What is being done for submarine
and naval air force construction is much too little. Our entire
war potential must work for the conduct of the war against
England; thus for the Navy and Air Force, every dispersion
of strength prolongs the war and endangers the final success.
Naval Supreme Commander voices serious objections against
Russia campaign before the defeat of England.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At Page 52 of the document book, on the 18th of February 1941,
there is the entry:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Chief of Naval Operations (SKL) insists on the occupation
of Malta even before Barbarossa.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the next page, on the 23rd of February, there is this interesting
entry:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Instruction from Supreme Command, Armed Forces (OKW)
that seizure of Malta ‘is contemplated for the fall of 1941
after the execution of Barbarossa’ ”—which the Tribunal
may think is a sublime example of wishful thinking.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next entry, for the 19th of March 1941, which is at Page 54
of the document book, shows that by March of 1941 Raeder had
begun to consider what prospects of naval action the Russian
aggression had to offer. There is the entry:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In case of Barbarossa, Supreme Naval Commander describes
the occupation of Murmansk as an urgent request of the
Navy; Chief of Supreme Command Armed Forces considers
compliance very difficult.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, the entries in this document show that Mussolini,
the flunky of Nazism, was crying out for a more active Nazi
Mediterranean policy. I refer the Court to Page 57 of the document
book, the entry for the 30th of May. The word “Duce” is omitted
from the first line, and the entry should read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Duce demands urgently decisive offensive Egypt-Suez for
fall 1941; 12 divisions needed for that. ‘This stroke would
be more deadly to the British Empire than the capture of
London’; Chief, Naval Operations, agrees completely.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then, finally, the entry for the 6th of June, indicating
strategic views of Raeder and the German Navy at this stage,
reads as follows. It is at Page 58 of the document book:
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Supreme Naval Commander with the Führer. Memorandum
of the Chief, Naval Operations: ‘Observation of the strategic
situation in the eastern Mediterranean after the Balkan
campaign and the occupation of Crete and further conduct
of the war.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>A few sentences below:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The memorandum points with impressive clarity to the
decisive aims of the war in the Near East. Their advancement
has moved into grasping distance by the successes in
the Aegean area and the memorandum emphasizes that the
offensive utilization of the present favorable situation must
take place with the greatest acceleration and energy, before
England has again strengthened her position in the Near
East with help from the United States of America. The
memorandum realizes the unalterable fact that the campaign
against Russia would be opened very shortly; but demands,
however, that the undertaking Barbarossa ‘which, because
of the magnitude of its aims, naturally stands in the foreground
of the operational plans of the armed forces leadership,’
must under no circumstances ‘lead to an abandonment,
diminishing, or delay of the conduct of the war in the eastern
Mediterranean.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>So that Raeder was, throughout, seeking an active role for his
Navy in the Nazi war plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, once Hitler had decided to attack Russia, Raeder sought a
role for his Navy in the campaign against Russia; and the first
naval operational plan against Russia was a particularly perfidious
one. I refer the Tribunal to the Document C-170 which I have just
been reading from, at Page 59 of the document book. There the
Tribunal will see an entry for the 15th of June 1941:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the proposal of Chief Naval Operations .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. use of arms
against Russian submarines south of the northern boundary
of the Öland warning area is permitted immediately; ruthless
destruction is to be aimed at.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Keitel provided a characteristically dishonest
pretext for this action in his letter, the Document C-38, which is
at Page 11 of the document book and which will be Exhibit GB-223.
The Tribunal sees that Keitel’s letter is dated the 15th of June 1941:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Subject: Offensive action against enemy submarines in the
Baltic Sea.</p>
<hr class='tbk357'/>
<p class='noindent'>“To: High Command of the Navy—OKM (SKL).</p>
<hr class='tbk358'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Offensive action against submarines south of the line
Memel-southern tip of Öland is authorized if the boats
cannot be definitely identified as Swedish during the approach
by German naval forces.
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk359'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The reason to be given up to B-day is that our naval forces
believed to be dealing with penetrating British submarines.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, that was on the 15th of June 1941, and the Tribunal will
remember that the Nazi attack on Russia did not take place until
the 22d of June of 1941. In the meantime Raeder was urging
Hitler, as early as the 18th of March 1941, to enlarge the scope
of the world war by inducing Japan to seize Singapore. The
relevant document is C-152, Exhibit GB-122, at Page 23 of the
document book. There is just one paragraph which I would like
to be permitted to read. The document describes the audience of
Raeder with Hitler on the 18th of March and the entries in it, in
fact, represent Raeder’s own views:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Japan must take steps to seize Singapore as soon as possible,
since the opportunity will never again be as favorable (whole
English fleet contained; unpreparedness of U.S.A. for war
against Japan; inferiority of U.S. fleet <span class='it'>vis-à-vis</span> the Japanese).
Japan is indeed making preparations for this action, but
according to all declarations made by Japanese officers she
will carry it out only if Germany proceeds to land in England.
Germany must therefore concentrate all her efforts on
spurring Japan to act immediately. If Japan has Singapore
all other East Asiatic questions regarding the U.S.A. and
England are thereby solved (Guam, Philippines, Borneo,
Dutch East Indies).</p>
<hr class='tbk360'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Japan wishes, if possible, to avoid war against the U.S.A.
She can do so if she determinedly takes Singapore as soon as
possible.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Japanese, of course, as events proved, had different ideas
from that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the 20th of April 1941, the evidence is that Hitler had agreed
with this proposition of Raeder’s of inducing the Japanese to take
offensive action against Singapore. I refer the Tribunal again to
the Document C-170 and to an entry at Page 56 of the document
book, for the 20th of April 1941. A few sentences from that read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Naval Supreme Commander with Führer. Navy Supreme
Commander asks about result of Matsuoka’s visit and
evaluation of Japanese-Russian pact.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Führer has informed
Matsuoka ‘that Russia will not be touched if she behaves
in a friendly manner according to the treaty. Otherwise, he
reserves action for himself.’ Japan-Russia pact has been
concluded in agreement with Germany and is to prevent
Japan from advancing against Vladivostok and to cause her
to attack Singapore.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now an interesting commentary upon this document is found
in the Document C-66, at Page 13 of the document book. The
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>
Document C-66 has already been exhibited as GB-81. I would
refer the Court to Paragraph 3 at Page 13 of the document book.
At that time the Führer was firmly resolved on a surprise attack
on Russia, regardless of what was the Russian attitude to Germany.
This, according to reports coming in, was frequently changing; and
there follows this interesting sentence: “The communication to
Matsuoka was designed entirely as a camouflage measure and to
ensure surprise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Axis partners were not even honest with each other, and
this, I submit, is typical of the kind of jungle diplomacy with which
Raeder associated himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now, with the Tribunal’s permission, turn from the field of
diplomacy to the final aspect of the case against Raeder, namely,
to crimes at sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution’s submission is that Raeder throughout his
career showed a complete disregard for any international rule or
usage of war which conflicted in the slightest with his intention of
carrying through the Nazi program of conquest. I propose to submit
to the Tribunal only a few examples of Raeder’s flouting of the
laws and customs of civilized states.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raeder has himself summarized his attitude in the most
admirable fashion in the Document UK-65, which the Tribunal will
find at Page 98 of the document book, and which will be Exhibit
GB-224. Now that Document UK-65 is a very long memorandum
compiled by Raeder and the German naval war staff on the 15th of
October 1939—that is to say, only a few weeks after the war started.
And it is a memorandum on the subject of the intensification of the
war at sea, and I desire to draw the Tribunal’s attention to the
bottom paragraph at Page 98 of the document book. It is headed,
“Possibilities of Future Naval Warfare”:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I. Military requirements for the decisive struggle against
Great Britain:</p>
<hr class='tbk361'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Our naval strategy will have to employ all the military
means at our disposal as expeditiously as possible. Military
success can be most confidently expected if we attack British
sea communications wherever they are accessible to us, with
the greatest ruthlessness; the final aim of such attacks is to
cut off all imports into and exports from Britain. We should
try to consider the interests of neutrals in so far as this is
possible without detriment to military requirements. It is
desirable to base all military measures taken on existing
international law; however, measures which are considered
necessary from a military point of view, provided a decisive
success can be expected from them, will have to be carried
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>
out, even if they are not covered by existing international
law. In principle, therefore, any means of warfare which is
effective in breaking enemy resistance should be based on
some legal conception”—the nature of which is not specified—“even
if that entails the creation of a new code of naval
warfare.</p>
<hr class='tbk362'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The supreme war council .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. will have to decide what
measures of military and legal nature are to be taken. Once
it has been decided to conduct economic warfare in its most
ruthless form, in fulfillment of military requirements, this
decision is to be adhered to under all circumstances. Under
no circumstances may such a decision for the most ruthless
form of economic warfare, once it has been made, be dropped
or released under political pressure from neutral powers; that
is what happened in the World War to our own detriment.
Every protest by neutral powers must be turned down. Even
threats of further countries, particularly of the United States,
coming into the war, which can be expected with certainty
should the war last a long time, must not lead to a relaxation
in the form of economic warfare once embarked upon. The
more ruthlessly economic warfare is waged, the earlier will
it show results and the sooner will the war come to an end.
The economic effect of such military measures on our own
war economy must be fully recognized and compensated
through immediate reorientation of German war economy
and the re-drafting of the respective agreements with neutral
states; for”—these are the final words—“for this, strong
political and economic pressure must be employed if necessary.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I submit that those comments are most revealing; and the
general submission of the Prosecution is that as an active member
of the inner council of the Nazi State right up to 1943, Raeder,
holding such ideas as these, must share responsibility for the many
War Crimes committed by his confederates and their underlings in
the course of the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But quite apart from this over-all responsibility of Raeder, there
are certain crimes which the Prosecution submits were essentially
initiated and passed down the naval chain of command by Raeder
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I refer to the Document C-27, at Page 7 of the document book,
which will be Exhibit GB-225. Those are minutes of a meeting
between Hitler and Raeder on the 30th of December 1939. I will
read with the Court’s approval the second paragraph beginning:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Chief of the Naval Operations Staff requests that full
power be given to the Naval Operations Staff in making any
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>
intensification suited to the situation and to the means of war.
The Führer agrees in principle to the sinking without warning
of Greek ships in the American prohibited area and of
neutral ships in those sections of the American prohibited
area in which the fiction of mine danger can be upheld, e.g.,
the Bristol Channel.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At this time, of course, as the Tribunal knows, Greek ships were
also neutral and I submit that this is yet another demonstration of
the fact that Raeder was a man without principle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This incitement to crime was, in my submission, a typical group
effort, because in the Document C-12, which is at Page 1 of the
document book, the Tribunal will see that a directive to the effect
of those naval views was issued on the 30th of December 1939 by
the OKW, being signed by the Defendant Jodl. And that Document
C-12 will be Exhibit GB-226. It is an interesting document. It is
dated the 30th of December 1939, and it reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the 30th of December 1939, according to a report of the
Supreme Commander of the Navy, the Führer and Supreme
Commander of the Armed Forces decided that:</p>
<hr class='tbk363'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1) Greek merchant ships in the area declared by England
and the U.S.A. to be a barred zone are to be treated as enemy
vessels.</p>
<hr class='tbk364'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2) In the Bristol Channel all shipping may be attacked
without warning—where the impression of a mining incident
can be created.</p>
<hr class='tbk365'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Both measures are authorized to come into effect immediately.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another example of the callous attitude of the German Navy,
when it was under Raeder’s command, towards neutral shipping,
is found in an entry in Jodl’s diary.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think perhaps you should read the pencil
note, oughtn’t you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR JONES: The pencil note on the Document C-12 reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Add to 1): Attack must be carried out without being seen.
The denial of the sinking of these steamships, in case the
expected protests are made, must be possible.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As I was saying, My Lord, another example of the callous attitude
of Raeder’s Navy towards neutral shipping is found in an entry
in Jodl’s diary for the 16th of June 1942, at Page 112 of the document
book, which is Document 1807-PS, and will be Exhibit GB-227.
This extract from Jodl’s Diary is dated the 16th of June 1942 and
it reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Operational Staff of the Navy (SKL) applied on the
29th May for permission to attack the Brazilian sea and air
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>
forces. The SKL considers that a sudden blow against the
Brazilian warships and merchant ships is expedient at this
juncture because defense measures are still incomplete,
because there is the possibility of achieving surprise, and
because Brazil is actually fighting Germany at sea.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This, the Tribunal will see, was a plan for a kind of Brazilian
“Pearl Harbor” because the Tribunal will recollect that war did not
in effect break out between Germany and Brazil until the 22d of
August 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raeder himself also caused the Navy to participate in War
Crimes ordered by other conspirators, and I shall give one example
only of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 28th of October 1942, as the Document C-179, Exhibit
USA-543, at Page 63 of the document book shows, the head of the
operations division of the naval war staff promulgated to naval
commands Hitler’s notorious order of the 18th of October 1942 with
regard to the shooting of Commandos which in my submission
amounted to denying the protection of the Geneva Convention to
captured Commandos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will remember the document is dated the 28th of
October 1942, and it reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Enclosed please find a Führer order regarding annihilation
of terror and sabotage units.</p>
<hr class='tbk366'/>
<p class='noindent'>“This order must not be distributed in writing to officers
below the rank of a flotilla leader or a section commander.
After verbal notification to subordinate sections such officers
must hand this order over to the next higher section which is
responsible for its withdrawal and destruction.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What clearer indication could there be than the nature of these
instructions as to the naval command’s appreciation of the wrongfulness
of the murders Hitler ordered?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Shall we adjourn now for 10 minutes?</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR JONES: I have drawn the Tribunal’s attention to the
circulation of Hitler’s order to shoot Commandos. I now draw the
Tribunal’s attention to an example of the execution of that order
by the German Navy during the period when Raeder was its
commander.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My learned friend Mr. Roberts has already given the Tribunal
an account of a Commando operation of December 1942, which had
as its objective an attack on shipping in Bordeaux harbor. The
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>
Tribunal will recollect that the Wehrmacht account he quoted, Document
UK-57, Exhibit GB-164, stated that six of the 10 participants
in that commando raid were arrested and that all were shot on the
23 March 1943. In connection with that episode the Prosecution
has a further document throwing more light on this Bordeaux
incident and showing how much more expeditiously the Navy
under Raeder had implemented Hitler’s order on this particular
occasion. I draw the Court’s attention to Document C-176, at
Page 61 of the document book, Exhibit GB-228.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That document consists of extracts from the war diary of
Admiral Bachmann, who was the German flag officer in charge of
western France. The first entry, at Page 61, is dated 10 December
1942 and reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“About 1015. Telephone call from personal representative of
the Commander of the SD in Paris, SS Obersturmführer
Dr. Schmidt, to flag lieutenant, requesting postponement of
the shooting, as interrogation had not been concluded.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk367'/>
<p class='noindent'>“After consultation with the Chief of Operations Staff, the SD
had been directed to get approval direct from headquarters.</p>
<hr class='tbk368'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1820. SD, Bordeaux, requested Superior SD Office at
Führer’s headquarters to postpone the shooting for 3 days.
Interrogations continued for the time being.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next day, 11 December 1942:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Shooting of two English prisoners was carried out by a
unit (strength 1/16 men) attached to the harbor command,
Bordeaux, in the presence of an officer of the SD on order of
the Führer.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then there is a note in green pencil in the margin opposite this
entry which reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“SD should have done this. Phone flag officer in charge in
future cases.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will therefore see from this Document C-176, that
the first two gallant men to be shot as a result of the Bordeaux
operation were actually put to death by a naval firing party on
the 11th of December 1942. They were Sergeant Wallace and
Marine Ewart, who had the misfortune to be captured on the 8th of
December in the preliminary stages of the operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of interest is the comment of the naval war staff upon this
shooting, which is found in Document D-658.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What do the last two lines in Document
C-176 about the operation being “particularly favored” mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR JONES: “The operation was particularly favored by the
weather conditions and the dark night”—that presumably, My Lord,
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>
is a reference to the operation of the marine Commandos in successfully
blowing up a number of German ships in Bordeaux harbor.
Alternately, I am advised by the naval officer who is assisting me,
that it probably is a reference to the conditions prevailing at the
time of the shooting of the two men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I should have thought so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR JONES: I stand corrected by the representative of the
British Navy upon my interpretation of the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Doesn’t it indicate that naval men had done it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR JONES: The shooting was in fact, as the entry of 11
December shows, carried out by a naval party—by units belonging
to the naval officer in charge of Bordeaux.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR JONES: I was seeking to draw the Tribunal’s attention
to the comment of the naval war staff upon that shooting, which is
in Document D-658, at Page 109, Exhibit GB-229. It reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Naval Commander, west France, reports that during the
course of the day explosives with magnets to stick on, mapping
material dealing with the mouth of the Gironde, aerial photographs
of the port installations at Bordeaux, camouflage
material, and food and water for several days were found.
Attempts to salvage the canoe were unsuccessful. The Naval
Commander west France has ordered that both soldiers be
shot immediately for attempted sabotage, if their interrogation,
which has begun, confirms what has so far been
discovered; their execution has, however, been postponed in
order to obtain more information.</p>
<hr class='tbk369'/>
<p class='noindent'>“According to a Wehrmacht report, both soldiers have meanwhile
been shot. The measure would be in accordance with
the Führer’s special order but is nevertheless something new
in international law, since the soldiers were in uniform.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I submit that that last sentence shows very clearly that the
Naval High Command under Raeder accepted allegiance to the Nazi
conspiracy as of greater importance than any question of moral
principle or of professional honor and integrity. This operation of
the shooting of those two Commandos was, as I submit, not an act
of war, but a murder of two gallant men; and it is upon this somber
note that it is my duty to summarize this part of the Prosecution’s
case against the Defendant Raeder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution’s submission is that he was not just a military
puppet carrying out political orders. The Tribunal has seen that,
before the Nazis came, he had worked actively to rebuild the
German Navy behind the back of the Reichstag. When the Nazis
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>
seized power, he unreservedly joined forces with them. He was the
prime mover in transferring the loyalty of the German Navy to the
Nazi Party. He was as much a member of the inner councils of
the Nazis as possibly any other defendant. And he was a member
of their main political advisory bodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was well aware of their aggressive designs and I submit he
assisted in their realization not only as a military technician, but
also as a mendacious politician. And he furthered, as I have submitted,
their brutal methods of warfare. And yet of all these
conspirators Raeder was one of the first to fall from his high
position. It is in fact true that the extension of war beyond the
boundaries of Poland came as a disappointment to him. His vision
of a Nazi armada mastering the Atlantic reckoned without Ribbentrop’s
diplomacy and Hitler’s ideas of strategy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would draw the Tribunal’s attention to Document C-161, at
Page 35 of the document book, which is an extract, Exhibit GB-230,
from a memorandum of Raeder, dated 10 January 1943, just before
his retirement, entitled, “The Importance of German Surface Forces
for Conducting the War by the Powers Signatory to the Three
Power Pact.” The material entry reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was planned by the leaders of the National Socialist
Reich to give the German Navy by 1944-45 such a strength
that it would be possible to strike at the British vital arteries
in the Atlantic with sufficient ships, fighting power, and range.</p>
<hr class='tbk370'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In 1939, the war having begun 5 years earlier, the construction
of these forces was still in its initial stages.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will see from that document how completely Raeder
was cheated in his ambitious plans by miscalculation as to when
his high seas fleet would be required. The Tribunal has seen that
Raeder made a great effort to recover some of his lost glory with
his attack on an inoffensive Norway. He made many efforts to liven
up the war at sea, both at the expense of neutrals and also of the
customs and laws of the sea. But his further schemes, however, were
disregarded by his fellow conspirators, and in January 1943, Raeder
retired, and thereafter he was a leader in name only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I invite the Court’s attention to the Document D-655, at Page 108
of the document book, Exhibit GB-231, which is a record in Raeder’s
handwriting of his interview with Hitler on the 6th of January 1943,
which led to Raeder’s retirement. I am only proposing to read the
fifth paragraph, in which Raeder records:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if the Führer was anxious to demonstrate that the
parting was of the friendliest character and wished that the
name Raeder should continue to be associated with the Navy,
particularly abroad, it would perhaps be possible to make an
appointment to the Inspector General, giving appropriate
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>
publicity in the press, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>. But a new Commander-in-Chief
of the Navy with full responsibility for this office must
be appointed. The position of Inspector General, or whatever
it was decided to call it, must be purely nominal.</p>
<hr class='tbk371'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Führer”—the record reads—“accepted this suggestion
with alacrity. The Inspector General could perhaps carry out
special tasks for him, make tours of inspection, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>. The
name of Raeder was still to be associated with the Navy. After
Commander-in-Chief of the Navy had repeated his request,
the Führer definitely agreed to 30th January as his release
date. He would like to think over the details.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This was Raeder’s twilight, and indeed a very different occasion
from the period of his ascendancy in 1939, when on the 12th of
March Raeder spoke on the occasion of the German Heroes’ Day.
I now refer the Court to the final document on Raeder, an account
of that speech in March 1939, which is at Page 103 of the document
book, in the Document D-653, Exhibit GB-232. The first paragraph
reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Throughout Germany celebrations took place on the occasion
of Hero Commemoration Day.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. These celebrations were
combined for the first time with the celebration of the freedom
to rearm.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The day’s chief event was the traditional ceremony
held in the Berlin State Opera House in Unter den
Linden.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the presence of Hitler and representatives of the Party and
Armed Forces, General-Admiral Raeder made a speech, extracts
from which are given below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turn to Page 2 of the record, Page 104 of the document book,
to about the 15th line:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“National Socialism”—says Raeder—“which originates from
the spirit of the German fighting soldier, has been chosen by
the German people as its ideology. The German people follow
the symbols of its regeneration with as much great love as
fanatical passion. The German people has had practical experience
of National Socialism and it has not been imposed,
as so many helpless critics abroad believe. The Führer has
shown his people that in the National Socialist solidarity of
the people lies the great and invincible source of strength,
whose dynamic power ensures not only peace at home but
also enables us to release all the Nation’s creative powers.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>There follow eulogies of Hitler, and a few sentences below:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This is the reason for the clear and unsparing summons to
fight Bolshevism and international Jewry, the nation-destroying
activities of which our own people have sufficiently
suffered. Therefore, the alliance with all like-minded nations
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>
who, like Germany, are not willing to allow their strength,
dedicated to construction and peaceful work at home, to be
disrupted by alien ideologies and by parasites of a foreign
race.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then a few sentences on:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“If later on we instruct in the technical handling of weapons,
this task demands that the young soldier should also be taught
National Socialist ideology and the problems of life. This part
of the task, which becomes for us both a duty of honor and a
demand which cannot be refused, can and will be carried out
if we stand shoulder to shoulder and in sincere comradeship
to the Party and its organizations.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The next sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Armed Forces and the Party thus became more and
more united in attitude and spirit.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then just two sentences on the next page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany is the protector of all Germans within and beyond
our frontiers. The shots fired at Almeria are proof of that.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That refers, of course, to the bombardment of the Spanish town
of Almeria, carried out by a German naval squadron on the 31 May
1937 during the course of the Spanish Civil War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are further references to the Führer and his leadership,
and then a final sentence of the first paragraph of Page 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“They all planted into a younger generation the great tradition
of death for a holy cause, knowing that with their blood they
will lead the way towards the freedom of their dreams.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My submission is that that speech of Raeder’s is the final proof
of his deep personal involvement in the Nazi conspiracy. There is
the mixture of heroics and fatalism that led millions of Germans to
slaughter. There are boasts of violence used on the people of Almeria.
There is the lip service to peace by a man who planned conquest.
“Armed Forces and the Party have become more and more united
in attitude and spirit”—there is the authentic Nazi voice. There is
the assertion of racialism. Finally, there is the anti-Semitic gesture,
Raeder’s contribution to the outlook that produced Belsen. Imbued
with these ideas he became an active participant on both the
political and military level in the Nazi conspiracy to wage wars of
aggression and to wage them ruthlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. RALPH G. ALBRECHT (Associate Trial Counsel for the
United States): May it please the Tribunal, the United States will
continue with the presentation, showing the individual responsibility
of the Defendant Von Schirach. It will be made by Captain Sprecher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPTAIN DREXEL A. SPRECHER (Assistant Trial Counsel for
the United States): May it please the Tribunal, it is my responsibility
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>
to present the individual responsibility of the Defendant Schirach
for Crimes against the Peace, War Crimes, and Crimes against
Humanity as they concern directly the Common Plan or Conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution contends that the Defendant Schirach is guilty
of having exercised a leading part in the Nazi conspiracy from 1925
until the Nazi downfall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conspiratorial acts and the criminality of the Defendant
Schirach may be grouped for purposes of convenience into three
principal phases: (1) His early support of the conspirators over the
period 1925-1929; (2) his leadership and direction of German youth
over the period 1929-1945; (3) his leadership of the Reichsgau Vienna
as chief representative of the Nazi Party and the Nazi State in
Vienna for the period July 1940 to 1945. The presentation will take
up each of these principal phases after a brief listing of all the
principal positions which Schirach held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In presenting first a listing of the positions held by Schirach, it
is not intended immediately to describe the functions of each of
these positions. Insofar as a description of the functions of any
particular position is still felt necessary at this stage of the Trial, it
will be given later during the discussion of Schirach’s conspiratorial
acts as Nazi Youth Leader and as Nazi official in Vienna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the consideration of the Tribunal, we have submitted a brief
on this subject. The document book contains English translations
of 29 documents. Although we feel that we have reduced the number
of documents to the minimum, the document book is still large. But
Schirach’s subversion of German youth is a large subject, even apart
from any of his other acts. Most of these documents are from
German publications, of which the Tribunal can take judicial notice.
Therefore, in most cases, it is intended only to paraphrase these
documents, unless the Tribunal in particular instances will indicate
that they like fuller treatment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before passing to the proof I want to express my appreciation,
particularly to Major Hartley Murray, Lieutenant Fred Niebergall
at my right, and Mr. Norbert Heilpern for their assistance in
research, analysis, translation, and organization of these materials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schirach agrees he held the following positions. They are found
in two affidavits, an affidavit of certificate and one affidavit of
report dated December 1945, which is Document 3302-PS, document
book, Page 110.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I want to offer that affidavit as Exhibit Number USA-665. The
certificate, which I will rely on for only one point, is Document
2973-PS. It is already in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-14.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning first to Document 3302-PS: This affidavit shows that
Schirach was a member of the Party from 1925 to 1945; that he was
a leader of the National Socialist Student League from 1929 to 1931;
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>
that he was leader of the Hitler Youth Organization from 1931 to
1940. In 1931 and 1932 Schirach was Reich Youth Leader on the
staff of the SA Supreme Command, where at that time all Nazi
youth organizations were centralized. Also, Schirach was Reich
Youth Leader of the NSDAP from 1931 to 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1932 Schirach became an independent Reich Leader (Reichsleiter),
in the Party. Upon acquiring this relatively independent
position, he no longer remained on the staff of the SA Supreme
Command, since Nazi youth affairs thereafter, with the creation of
the Reich Youth Leadership, were directly subordinate to Hitler
with Schirach at the helm. We had that kind of condition existing
in the Party where, under the Leadership Principle, at the pinnacle
you had one man, Schirach, and you no longer had the youth
affairs underneath the SA. However, within the SA, Schirach
retained the rank and the title of a Gruppenführer throughout the
period from 1931 to 1941, and in that year, 1941, he was elevated to
the rank of an SA Obergruppenführer, a rank which Schirach continued
to hold in the SA until the collapse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schirach was Reich Leader of Youth Education in the NSDAP
from 1932 until the collapse. In other words, from before the Nazis
came to state power until the final downfall, this defendant held the
high position of a Reichsleiter, a Reich Leader, inside the Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, in addition to these positions in the Party, Schirach held
the following positions in the Nazi State:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reich Youth Leader, 1933 to 1940; Reich governor (Reichsstatthalter)
of the Reichsgau Vienna, 1940 to 1945; Reich Defense Commissioner
of Vienna, 1940 to 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, although Schirach gave up some of his positions with
respect to the leadership of German youth in 1940 when he accepted
these positions in Vienna, he still continued to hold after that time
the Party position of Reich Leader for Youth Education in the
NSDAP. Moreover, he was given a very special position: Deputy to
the Führer for the Inspection of the Hitler Youth, the organization
which he, of course, had led until 1940. He continued in these last
two positions until the downfall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The certificate, Document 2973-PS, the only thing I rely on there
in this particular presentation, is to show that Schirach was a
member of the Reichstag from 1932 to 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We next take up acts showing that Schirach actively promoted
the NSDAP and its affiliated youth organizations before the Nazis
seized power. Schirach was an intimate and a servile follower of
Hitler from the year 1925. In that year, when he was only 18 years
old, Schirach joined the Nazi conspirators by becoming a member of
the Party. Upon special request of Hitler, he went to Munich to
study Party affairs. He became active in converting students to
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>
National Socialism. I am paraphrasing there, Your Honors, from
Paragraph 2 of Schirach’s own affidavit, Document 3302-PS, Exhibit
Number USA-665, found at Page 110 of the document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, this was the start of conspiratorial activities which Schirach
thereafter continued for two decades in a spirit of unbending loyalty
to Hitler and to the principles of National Socialism. Hitler’s early
personal attentions to this defendant bore fruit for the conspirators,
and we find Schirach’s stature in the Party circles rapidly growing
through these early years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1929 Schirach was made national leader of the entire National
Socialist German Students League. He retained this position for
2 years until 1931. Document 3464-PS, document book, Page 121, is
an extract from the 1936 edition of the Party manual, Exhibit
Number USA-666, which I would like to offer in evidence. This
makes it clear that the purpose of the Nazi Students League was the
ideological and political conversion of students in universities and
technical schools to National Socialism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After 1931 Schirach devoted his full time to Party work. Schirach
was elected a Nazi member of the Reichstag in 1932, and therefore
he played his part in the unparliamentary conduct of the Nazi
Reichstag members during the last months of the existence of the
Reichstag as an independent instrument of government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the best evidence concerning Schirach’s support of the
conspiracy in its early stages comes from Schirach’s own words in
his book <span class='it'>The Hitler Youth</span>. Excerpts from this book are found in
Document Number 1458-PS, document book, Page 1. It is offered
in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-667. Now, since this book, Your
Honors, covers many years and many topics, I shall be required to
refer to it occasionally later on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An example of Schirach’s servile loyalty to Hitler during the
early years is found at Page 17 of this book, Page 12 of your
document book. There he writes of his early years of Party activity
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We were not yet able to account for our conception in detail.
We simply believed. And when Hitler’s book <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>
was published, it was our bible, which we almost learned by
heart in order to answer the questions of the doubters and
superior critics. Almost everyone who today is leading youth
in a responsible position joined us in those years.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Before 1933 Schirach moved throughout Germany, leading demonstrations,
summoning German youth to membership in the Hitler
Youth. When the Hitler Youth and the wearing of its uniform were
forbidden by law, Schirach continued his activities by illegal means.
Of this period he himself writes, at Page 26 of his book on <span class='it'>The
Hitler Youth</span>, Pages 16 and 17 of your document book, as follows:
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At this time the HJ (the Hitler Jugend) gained its best
human material. Whoever came to us during this illegal time,
boy or girl, risked everything.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. With pistols in our pockets
we drove through the Ruhr district while stones came flying
after us. We jumped every time we heard a bell ring, because
we lived in constant fear of arrests and expected our houses
to be searched.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At Page 27 of the same book, Page 18 of Your Honors’ document
book, Schirach indicates that in the early intra-Party fight between
Hitler and Strasser, Schirach clung steadfastly to the Hitler clique,
and then, in discussing Strasser, he exchanged his confidence only
with Hitler and the Defendant Streicher. It is hardly necessary to
argue that such an intimate of the Führer, himself, was advised
from the beginning of the general purposes, plans, and methods of
the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As an interesting sidelight, I believe a number of those conferences,
you will note, took place in Schirach’s apartment in
Munich, and that Hitler used to come there occasionally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schirach was the leading Nazi conspirator in destroying all
independent youth organizations and in building the Nazi youth
movement. In connection with this point, the attention of the
Tribunal is invited to the brief of the United States Chief of Counsel
entitled “The Reshaping of Education, Training of Youth,” which
was written for the United States Chief of Counsel by Major Hartley
Murray, and to the documents cited therein under the section
headed “b.” “The Nazi conspirators supplemented the school system
by training youth through the Hitler Jugend.” These documents
were offered in evidence in Document Book D in the earlier phase
of this Trial. The attention of the Tribunal is also called to the
motion picture <span class='it'>The Nazi Plan</span>, which was shown before the Tribunal
on the 11th of December, insofar as that film involved the Defendant
Schirach and his Hitler Youth organization. Occasions when
Schirach’s activities are shown in this film are noted in Document
Number 3054-PS, the index and the guide to this film, which is
already in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-167.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the task of Schirach to perpetuate the Nazi regime through
generations by poisoning the minds of youth with Nazi ideology
and preparing youth for aggressive war. This poisoning will long
outlive the defendant. Indeed, one of the principal purposes of
this exposure must be to bring to those German youths who
survived the Nazi-created catastrophe a true picture of this man
whom Nazi propaganda presented as a great youth hero; a man
against whom the living breath of free criticism and the truth itself
could make no answer before German youth or before the German
people, for more than 10 years.
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, from Schirach’s own hand in his book, <span class='it'>The Hitler Youth</span>,
we have crystal-clear evidence concerning the methods and the
tactics employed by this defendant in his destruction of independent
youth organizations and their incorporation into the Hitler Youth.
At Page 32, Pages 19 and 20 of Your Honors’ document book,
Schirach states that in 1933 the new Cabinet ministers were too
overburdened to solve the youth question by their own initiative;
that therefore he, Schirach, then leader of the Hitler Youth, commissioned
one of his confederates to lead 50 members of the Berlin
Hitler Youth in a surprise raid on the Reich Committee of German
Youth Organizations. This raid resulted in destroying the Reich
Committee and its absorption within the Hitler Youth. This raid
was closely followed by a second surprise raid of like success upon
the Youth Hostels Organization, Page 33, <span class='it'>The Hitler Youth</span>, found
at Pages 20 and 21 of the document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, after these successful showings of force and terror,
Schirach’s star climbed higher. He was appointed Youth Leader
of the German Reich in June 1931 in a solemn ceremony before
Hitler. Concerning his next steps, Schirach writes at Pages 35
and 36 of his book, Page 22 of the document book, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The first thing I did was to dissolve the Greater German
League. Since I headed all German youth organizations and
I had the right to decide on their leadership, I did not
hesitate for a moment to take this step which was for the
Hitler Youth the elimination of an unbearable state of
affairs.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Schirach accomplished the dissolution and destruction of most
youth organizations by orders which he issued and signed as Youth
Leader of the German Reich. This is shown by the order contained
in Document Number 2229-PS, your document book, Page 65, which
is offered in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-668.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this one order of Schirach nine youth organizations were
dissolved, including the Boy Scout movement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Protestant and Catholic youth organizations were the last to
be destroyed and absorbed by the Hitler Youth. Schirach accomplished
the absorption of the Protestant youth organization by
agreement with the Hitler-appointed Reich Bishop Ludwig Müller,
Page 38 of <span class='it'>The Hitler Youth</span>, Page 24 of the document book.
Schirach’s objective in forcing all German youth into the Hitler
Youth was finally accomplished in December 1936 by the basic law
on the Hitler Youth. Document Number 1392-PS is a decree, 1936,
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, Page 993, of which, of course, the Tribunal
may take judicial notice. This law declared in part, and Your
Honors, I read from this because it shows so clearly the nature of
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span>
what was to happen and what was already happening to German
youth under Schirach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is it set out in the document book?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What page?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: It is Document Number 1392-PS. It is at
Page 6 of your document book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The future of the German nation depends on its youth, and
German youth will have to be prepared for its future
duties.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All of the German youth in the Reich is organized
within the Hitler Youth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The German youth, besides being
reared within the family and school, shall be educated
physically, intellectually, and morally in the spirit of National
Socialism to serve the people and the community through the
Hitler Youth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The task of educating the German youth
through the Hitler Youth is being entrusted to the Reich
Leader of German Youth in the NSDAP.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The first executive order on this basic law concerning the Hitler
Youth was issued on the 25th of March 1939. If you refer to Page 40
of your document book, this decree, 1939, <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I,
Page 709, among other points confirms the exclusive nature of
Schirach’s responsibility concerning German youth. I will quote
only one sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Youth Leader of the German Reich is solely competent
for all missions of the physical, ideological, and moral education
of the entire German youth outside home and school.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Captain Sprecher, I think you have told us
enough now to satisfy us that Von Schirach was in charge, of the
ideological education of German youth and completely in charge of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And we don’t desire to hear any more of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: I understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In exercising his far-reaching control over German youth,
Schirach naturally relied on the common techniques of the Nazi
conspirators, including the Leadership Principle, the nature of which
has already been established before this Tribunal. The Tribunal will
find a galling glorification and explanation of the Leadership
Principle as it was applied to German youth, in Schirach’s book,
<span class='it'>The Hitler Youth</span>, at Page 68, translated at Page 32 of the document
book. I won’t read from that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his affidavit, Document Number 3302-PS, Paragraph 5,
Schirach states, “It was my task to educate the youth in the aims,
<span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>
ideology, and directives of the NSDAP, and beyond this to direct
and to shape them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally, Schirach established and directed an elaborate
propaganda apparatus to accomplish a thorough-going poisoning of
the minds of German youth. Document Number 3349-PS, your
document book Page 114, is offered in evidence as Exhibit
Number USA-666.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is an excerpt from Pages 452 and 453 of the 1936 edition
of the Party manual. This document will show that the Reich
Youth Leadership (Reichsjugendführung) of the NSDAP prepared
and published numerous periodicals ranging from a daily press
service to monthly magazines. This document also shows that the
propaganda office of the Hitler Youth maintained, through liaison
agents, a political and ideological connection with the propaganda
office of the NSDAP and with the Propaganda Ministry, both of
which, of course, were headed by the conspirator Goebbels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schirach shares with the conspirator Dr. Robert Ley, Reich
Organizationsleiter of the NSDAP, the responsibility for the
establishment and general administration of the Adolf Hitler
Schools. This is shown by a joint statement of Ley and Schirach
in the year 1937, which is found in the document book at Page 100.
It is our Document 2653-PS, offered in evidence as Exhibit
Number USA-669. This document shows that these Adolf Hitler
Schools were open free of charge to outstanding and proved
members of the Young Folk, the junior section of the Hitler Youth
organization. It further shows that the object of these schools was
the building of youthful leadership for the Nazi Party and the Nazi
State apparatus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schirach extended his education of German Youth into the field
of law and the legal profession even though these fields were
principally under the control of the Defendant Frank. Proof is found
in Document Number 3459-PS, Page 120 of the document book.
This is a one-page extract from an account of the Congress of
German Law in 1939. It is offered as Exhibit Number USA-670.
This document shows that beyond purely technical education in law
it was considered by the conspirators to be the task of the Party
to exercise influence upon the ideological conceptions of the Young
Law Guardians League. This league was a junior organization of
the National Socialist Law Guardians League, a Nazi-controlled
organization of lawyers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, at this Congress to which the document refers, an official
of the youth law guardians declared that ignorance of the simplest
legal principles could best be fought within the Hitler Youth and
that, therefore, the legal education program of the Hitler Youth
was to receive the broadest support.
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Obergebietsführer Arthur Axmann, the subordinate of Schirach
at that time and who in 1940 was to succeed him as leader of the
Hitler Youth, was at that time, namely, May 1939, appointed the
chairman of a youth legal committee for the establishment of the
Youth Law. He was appointed by the Defendant Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Captain Sprecher, I don’t think I made it
quite clear that the Tribunal is not really interested in these details
by which the Defendant Von Schirach acquired his power over the
German Youth. You have told us sufficient to establish in our
minds, so far at any rate, that he managed to get absolute command
over the German youth. The only thing that seems to me to be
material, at the present stage, is whether or not you can show us
any direct evidence that the Defendant Schirach was a party to the
aggressive aims of the Reich leaders, or to any War Crimes or to
any Crimes against Humanity. Unless you can show us that, your
address to us is really not useful to us at this stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: I plan to take up directly, Your Honor,
the question of the militarization of youth. I did want to make
one reference at this point to the relation of the Hitler Youth to
the League for Germans Abroad, if that is satisfactory to
Your Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, that may bear on the aggressive aims
of the Reich leaders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: Schirach extended the influence of the
Hitler Youth beyond the borders of Germany by means of co-operation
between the Hitler Youth and the League for Germans
Abroad, the VDA. This is proved by an agreement made in 1933
between Schirach and leaders of the VDA which is contained in
Document L-360(h), document book Page 3. This is offered in
evidence as Exhibit Number USA-671.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, Schirach discusses in his book, <span class='it'>The Hitler Youth</span>, under
the chapter heading, “Work Abroad”—that is Chapter 4 of the book,
Pages 34 to 38 of the document book—some of the connections of
the Hitler Youth with such Nazi ideas as Lebensraum, colonial
policy as an ideological weapon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I won’t read from that, since it also covers to a certain extent.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Did it talk about Lebensraum?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: It actually used the word Lebensraum. At
Page 36 of the document book there is reference made to the
Ostraum, space in the East.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I thought the document you were dealing
with was L-360 on Page 3.
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: I am sorry. I had gone on from there, to
speak about Schirach’s book, Document 1458-PS, and I had mentioned
that at Pages 34 to 38 of the document book there were
references concerning the Nazi ideas of colonial policy and Lebensraum,
and that this book by Schirach indicated that the Hitler
Youth was charged with spreading those ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He uses the word “Ostraum” in speaking of space in the East,
and he discusses German youth organizations abroad and the
German schools in these countries. And then I wish particularly to
point out on Page 37 the following sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It will be taken into consideration concerning this schooling
that the guiding line of German population policy which aims
at the utilization of the space in the East will not be
violated.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, the conspirators devoted a great deal of energy to the
perpetuation of their scheme of things by selecting and training
successors for Nazi leadership, selecting and training and acquiring
active Nazis for the rank and file of the NSDAP and its affiliated
organizations, including the SA and the SS which are alleged here
to be criminal organizations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of orders issued by the Party Chancellery under the
heading, “Successor Problems,” show the dominant part assumed by
Schirach and his Hitler Youth in this field. Our Document Number
3348-PS, “Selections from Volume I of the Decrees, Regulations, and
Announcements of the Party Chancellery,” already marked in
evidence as Exhibit Number USA-410, contains some of these orders,
which I won’t take the time to read. But they are all contained on
one page, Page 113, of your document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only Hitler Youth members who distinguished themselves were
to be admitted to the Party. Nazi leaders were directed to absorb
full-time Hitler Youth leaders into their staffs so as to offer them
practical experience and thus secure necessary successors for the
Leadership Corps which is also alleged as a criminal organization.
This pivotal and central function of the Hitler Youth in the domination
of German life by the Party is also shown at Pages 80 and 81
of the 1938 Party manual, Exhibit Number USA-430, found at Page
74 of the document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That last page, Page 113, does that refer to
any of the matters to which I drew your attention? It is simply the
organization of the youth; it has nothing to do with any criminal aims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: Your Honor, it certainly is the contention of
the Prosecution that any man who took an active part in furnishing
for these criminal organizations young members committed a crime.
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I quite understand that, and that is why I
told you that we were satisfied that so far you had shown that he
had acquired absolute control over and was the leader of the
German youth. The only thing we want to hear about at this stage
is whether he was a party to the schemes for aggressive war, to War
Crimes, or to Crimes against Humanity. That is what we want to
hear, and we don’t want to hear anything else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: Your Honors, may I pass, then, to the
connection of Hitler Youth to the SS. Document 2396-PS, which is
found at Page 69 of the document book and which is offered as
Exhibit Number USA-673, has a quotation in it concerning the
Streifendienst of the Hitler Youth; the Streifendienst being the patrol
service, a type of self-police organization of the Hitler Youth. The
quotation which I intend to read will indicate how this organization
became the principal supplier of the SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Are Your Honors interested in having me read that quotation
concerning the Hitler Youth as the main source of the SS?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, perhaps; I haven’t read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: This document is an agreement between
Schirach and Himmler. It was concluded in October 1938. It bears,
I think, partial quoting:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Organization of the Streifendienst.</p>
<hr class='tbk372'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. Since the Streifendienst in the Hitler Youth has to perform
tasks similar to those which the SS perform for the whole
movement, it is organized as a special unit for the purpose of
securing recruits for the General SS. However, as much as
possible, recruits for the SS Special Troops, for the SS Death’s
Head Units, and for the officer-candidate schools, should also
be taken from these formations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I am skipping down now to 4a, which is underlined in red in your
book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The selection of Streifendienst members is made according to
the principles of racial selection of the Schutzstaffel. The
competent officials of the SS, primarily unit leaders, race
authorities, and SS physicians, will be consulted for the
admission tests.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Skipping to 5:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“To insure from the beginning a good understanding between
Reich Youth Leadership and Reich SS leadership, a liaison
officer will be ordered from the Reich Youth Leadership to
the SS Main Office starting 1 October 1938. The appointment
of other leaders to the higher SS sections is a subject for a
future agreement.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, going down to what I think is the most striking quotation,
Your Honor, 6:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“After the organization is completed, the SS takes its
replacement primarily from these Streifendienst members.
Admission of youths of German blood who are not members
of the Hitler Youth is then possible only after information
and advice of the competent Bannführer.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, the Bannführer referred to there was the local leader of
the Hitler Jugend; and without his consent no one could go into the
SS in the future after that agreement was made, which was in
October 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, the second agreement which Schirach made with Himmler
was made in December 1938. It is found in our document book,
Number 2567-PS, Page 98. It is offered in evidence as Exhibit
Number USA-674. It states that the Farm Service of the Hitler Youth
“is, according to education and aim, particularly well suited as a
recruiting agency for the SS, General SS, and the armed section of
the SS, SS Special Troops, and SS Death’s Head battalions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The agreement concludes by stating that Farm Service members
of the Hitler Youth who pass the SS admission tests will be taken
over by the SS immediately after leaving the Hitler Youth Farm
Service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I might point out to Your Honors that this meant that after that
time any Hitler Youth member who was in the Farm Service was
obliged to go into the SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, to come directly to the point you have been inquiring
about, Your Honor:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the 6 years of Nazi political control over Germany
before the launching of aggressive war, Schirach was actively
engaged in militarizing German youth. From the beginning, the Hitler
Youth was set up along military lines with uniforms, ranks and
titles. It was regimented and led in military fashion under the
Leadership Principle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Your Honors will take any edition whatsoever of the <span class='it'>Organization
Book</span>, the Party manual, and turn to the tables, beginning
with Table 54, and leaf through the book, you will see the very
striking insignia of the Hitler Youth and how much it compares to
what the normal military insignia were. You will further notice
that one of the most prominent insignia is an “S” of the same type
that the Nazis used with respect to the SS. You will notice that
part of the uniform was a long knife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Isn’t that all a part of what they are pleased
to call the Nazi ideology? I mean, the Führer Principle, military
training?
<span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: There is a relation between all of these
things, perhaps, and the Leadership Principle, because the Leadership
Principle dominated absolutely every aspect of German life.
However, Your Honors, I suggest that showing to you, in this
graphic means, the similarity between the uniform of the Hitler
Youth and military uniforms has some bearing upon the preparation
for aggressive wars, about which I am further to speak in just a
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, Document 2654-PS, found at Page 102 of your document
book, is a whole book given over to just this question of the
organization and the insignia of the Hitler Youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will see how the Hitler Youth was divided into
branches or divisions which were very similar to military divisions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That document is offered as Exhibit Number USA-675. I will
refer no further to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, in a speech in February 1938, when the conspirators had
already dropped some of the camouflage which surrounded their
earlier military preparations for the wars which we have recently
suffered, Hitler discussed the military training of the Hitler Youth
in the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> of the 21st of February 1938. This is
our Document 2454-PS, found at Page 97 of the document book. It is
offered as Exhibit Number USA-676.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler there said that thousands of German boys had received
specialized training through the Hitler Youth in naval, aviation, and
motorized groups and that over 7,000 instructors had trained more
than 1 million Hitler Youth members in rifle shooting. That was
February 1938, shortly before the Anschluss. Note the progress of
military training within the Hitler Youth between then and August
1939, just 1 month before the invasion of Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time the Defendant Schirach and the Defendant Keitel,
as Chief of the High Command, entered into another one of those
informative agreements, which many of these defendants liked to
make among themselves. It is Document Number 2398-PS, your
document book Page 72. It is offered as Exhibit Number USA-677.
It is taken from <span class='it'>Das Archiv</span> which, in introducing the actual
agreement, declared that this agreement was “the result of close
co-operation” between Schirach and Keitel. The agreement itself
states, in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“While it is exclusively the task of the Hitler Youth to attend
to the training of their units in this direction, it is suitable,
in the sense of a uniformed training corresponding to the
demands of the Wehrmacht, to support the leadership of the
Hitler Youth for their responsible task as trainers and
educators in all fields of training for defense by special
courses.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, skipping down towards the end, you will note this
quotation within the agreement: “A great number of courses are in
progress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your Honor, if I may take about 5 minutes, I can finish this one
section on the aggressive war phase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: Whereas Hitler, in February 1938, mentioned
that 7,000 Hitler Youth leaders were engaged in training German
youngsters in rifle shooting, Schirach and Keitel, in their agreement
of August 1939, note the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 30,000 Hitler Youth leaders are already being trained
annually in field service. The agreement with the Wehrmacht
gives the possibility of roughly doubling that number. The
billeting and messing of the Hitler Youth leaders is done,
according to the regulations for execution already published,
in the barracks, drill grounds, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, of the Wehrmacht,
at a daily cost of 25 Pfennig.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Just as Schirach dealt with the head of the SS in obtaining
zealous recruits for organized banditry and the commission of
atrocities, so also he dealt with the head of the Wehrmacht in
furnishing young men as human grist for the mill of aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The training of German youths runs through the Nazi conspiracy
as an important central thread. It is one of the manifestations of
Nazism which has shocked the entire civilized world. The principal
responsibility for the planning and execution of the Nazi Youth
policy falls upon this defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish to take merely one sentence from his own affidavit,
Paragraph 5, Document Number 3302-PS, so that there can be no
doubt before this Tribunal or before the world, indeed, as to this
defendant’s own feeling of responsibility: “I feel myself responsible
for the policy of the youth movement in the Party and later within
the Reich.” I underline the phrase “<span class='it'>I feel myself responsible</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your Honor, that is a convenient breaking point before coming
to a discussion of Schirach’s connection to War Crimes and Crimes
against Humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 16 January 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span><h1>THIRTY-FIFTH DAY<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>Wednesday, 16 January 1946</span></h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: May it please the Tribunal, I now pass to
activities which involve Schirach in the commission of Crimes against
Humanity as they bear directly on Count One. The presentation of
all specific acts will deal with the Reichsgau Vienna; but first allow
me to refer back to two important points in the previous proof,
which will show that Schirach bears responsibility for War Crimes
and Crimes against Humanity which bring in the whole of Europe.
Through his agreements with Himmler he provided, through the
Hitler Youth, many if not most of the SS men who administered,
in the main, the concentration camps and whose War Crimes and
Crimes against Humanity throughout Europe generally are notorious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor should we pass to further specific acts of Schirach without
mentioning one more thing: that he cannot escape responsibility for
implanting in youth the Nazi ideology generally, with its tenets of
a master race, sub-human peoples, and Lebensraum and world
domination. For such notions were the psychological prerequisites
for the instigation and for the tolerance of the atrocities which
zealous Nazis committed throughout Germany and the occupied
countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To present Schirach’s responsibilities for crimes committed within
the Reichsgau Vienna, where Schirach was Gau leader and Reich
governor from July 1940 until the downfall, the general basic
functions of these two offices must be held in mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first document I refer to is Document Number 1893-PS. This
is an extract from the Party manual of 1943 and therefore catches
Schirach in midstream in his activities in the Reichsgau Vienna.
That is Page 42 of the document book, and Pages 70, 71, 75, 98, 136,
and 140b of the Party manual, extracts from each of those pages
appearing in your document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following highlights concerning the Gau leader’s functions
will appear, and I propose only to paraphrase. Since Your Honor
may take judicial notice of the Party manual, you may check at your
leisure unless you wish me to read from any one of these specific
orders. These orders make it appear that the Gau leader was the
highest representative of Hitler in his Gau, that he was the bearer
of sovereignty—the top Hoheitsträger—and that he had sovereign
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span>
political rights. Beyond that, he was responsible for the entire political
situation in his Gau. He could call—and we believe this is
important—he could call upon SA and SS leaders as “needed in the
execution of a political mission.” Beyond that he was obliged to
meet at least once a month with the leaders of the affiliated Party
organizations within his Gau, and this, of course, included the SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, the position of the Reich Governor in Vienna is somewhat
special. After the Anschluss the State of Austria was
abolished, and Austria was divided into seven Reich Gaue. The most
important of these Gaue was the Reichsgau Vienna, of which Schirach
was Governor. Reference to any statistical manual of the Reich at
this time will establish that at that time Vienna had a population
of over 2 million people. Therefore it was certainly one of the
principal cities of the Reich. The Tribunal is asked to take judicial
notice of the decree, 1939 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, Page 777, our
Document Number 3301-PS, found at Page 107 of the document
book. This is the basic law on the administrative reorganization of
Austria. It was enacted in April 1939, a little more than a year
before Schirach became Governor. This law shows that Schirach, as
Governor, was the lieutenant of the head of the German State, Hitler;
that he could issue decrees and orders within the limitations set by
the supreme Reich authorities; that he was especially under the
administrative supervision of the Defendant Frick, Reich Minister of
the Interior; and that he was also the first mayor of the city of
Vienna. For the same period that Schirach was Gau leader and Reich
Governor of Vienna, he was also Reich Defense Commissioner of
Vienna; and after 1940, of course, the Reich was engaged in war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Because of his far-reaching responsibilities and authority in these
positions, the Prosecution contends that Schirach must be held guilty,
specifically, of all the crimes of the Nazi conspirators in the Reichsgau
Vienna, on the ground that he either initiated, approved,
executed, or abetted these crimes. Specific examples follow which,
in fact, demonstrate that Schirach was actively and personally
engaged in Nazi crimes, and that, when he became boastful—a
characteristic never lacking in most of these defendants—he
himself admitted his own involvement in acts which are crimes
within the competence of this Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I come first to slave-labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slave-labor program naturally played its part in staffing
the industries of as large and important a city as Vienna. The
general nature of this program and the crimes flowing therefrom
have been in part set before you by Mr. Dodd. The Soviet prosecutors
will present further acts later on. Our Document
Number 3352-PS, found at Page 116 of your document book, which
I would like to offer as Exhibit USA-206, gives extracts from a
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span>
number of orders of the Party chancellery. Each of these orders
from which the extracts have been taken bear on the Gau leader’s
responsibility for manpower placement and utilization. They prove
quite simply and in unmistakable language that the Gau leaders
under the direction of the experienced old Gau leader Sauckel, who
was plenipotentiary for manpower, became the supreme integrating
and co-ordinating agents of the Nazi conspirators in the entire
manpower program. At Page 116 of your document book—Page 508
of the original volume of orders—the Defendant Göring is shown
to have agreed, as leader of the Four Year Plan, to Sauckel’s
suggestion that the Gau leaders be utilized to assure the highest
efficiency in manpower. At Page 117 of your document book—Page
511 of the orders of the Party chancellery—Sauckel in July
1942 makes the Gau leaders his special plenipotentiaries for manpower
within their Gaue, with the duty of establishing a harmonious
co-operation of all interests concerned. In effect the Gau leader
became the supreme arbitrator for all the conflicting interests that
exist during wartime with respect to claims upon manpower. Under
this same order the regional labor offices and their staffs were
“directed to be at the disposal of the Gau leaders for information
and advice and to fulfill the suggestions and demands of the Gau
leader for the purpose of improvements in manpower.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” At
Pages 118 and 119 of your document book—Page 567 of the Party
chancellery orders—the Defendant Sauckel ordered that his special
plenipotentiaries, the Gau leaders, familiarize themselves with the
general regulations on Eastern Workers. He stated that his
immediate objective was “to prevent politically inept factory heads
giving too much consideration to the care of Eastern Workers and
thereby cause justified annoyance among the German workers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We submit to the Tribunal that if Schirach as Gau leader was
required to concern himself in such manpower details as concern
over the alleged annoyance of German workers for the consideration
given Eastern Workers, it is unnecessary to press further
into the detailed workings of the manpower program to establish
Schirach’s connection with, and responsibility for, the slave-labor
program in the Reichsgau Vienna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now pass to the persecution of the churches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The elimination of the religious youth organizations while
Schirach was chief Nazi youth leader has already been noted. In
March 1941 two letters, one from the Defendant Bormann, the other
from the conspirator Hans Lammers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Captain Sprecher, have you any other
evidence which connects Von Schirach with the problem of manpower?
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: I had planned on presenting nothing further,
Your Honor. I felt that in view of the fact that our Soviet colleagues
are going further with the details of the manpower program,
particularly in the East, the main objective under Count One should
merely be to show the general responsibility of the Defendant
Schirach for the slave-labor program, and the question of specific
acts will have to be taken from the other proof in the Record,
which will come, into the Record later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: There is just one further point: When I
come to the treatment of the Jews in a few minutes, there will be
one or two specific examples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are now going to deal with the persecution
of churches, is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, the Tribunal is referred to Document R-146, at Page 5 of
the document book. This is offered as Exhibit USA-678.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am a little in doubt, Your Honors, as to whether I should read
all this document, in view of our common anxiousness to pass
rapidly on; but perhaps I may paraphrase it, and if you are not
satisfied I will read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These documents establish clearly that during a visit by Hitler
to Vienna, Schirach and two other officials brought a complaint
before the Führer that the confiscations of Church property in
Austria, made on various pretexts, should be made in favor of the
Gaue rather than of the Reich. Later the Führer decided the issue
in favor of the position which had been taken by Schirach, namely,
in favor of the Gau. I use this merely to connect Schirach with the
persecution of the churches, concerning which there has been a
great deal of evidence before this time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): None of it is in evidence yet.
You have not put anything in evidence. We cannot take judicial
notice of something unless you ask us to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: Your ruling is that this would not be in
evidence unless I read it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): I am not making any ruling;
I was merely pointing out to you that we have nothing in evidence
on the last document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: I think, under the circumstances, I had
better read this document:</p>

<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk374'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Recently, valuable church properties have had to be sequestered
on a large scale, especially in Austria; according to
reports of the Gauleiter to the Führer, these sequestrations
were often because of violations of ordinances relating to
war economy (for example, hoarding of foodstuffs of various
kinds, textiles, leather goods, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>). In other cases they
were for violations of the law relating to subversive acts
against the State and in some cases because of illegal possession
of arms. Obviously no compensation is to be paid to the
churches for sequestrations made for the above-mentioned
reasons.</p>
<hr class='tbk375'/>
<p class='noindent'>“With regard to further sequestrations, several Austrian Gau
leaders, on the occasion of the Führer’s last visit to Vienna,
attempted to clarify the question of who should acquire such
sequestered properties. Please take note of the Führer’s
decision, as contained in the letter written by Reich Minister
Dr. Lammers to the Reich Minister of the Interior, dated
14 March 1941. I enclose copy of extracts of the same.”—Signed—“M.
Bormann.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I had offered that document as Exhibit USA-678. Do you still
wish me to read the enclosure that went with it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): I don’t wish you to read
anything; I was simply pointing out that, as you had not read it,
it was not in evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: In that event I will continue, Your Honor.
The copy reads as follows:</p>

an ordinance supplementing the provisions on confiscation of
property of enemies of the People and State.</p>
<hr class='tbk377'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Reichsstatthalter and Gauleiter Von Schirach, Dr. Jury
and Eigruber complained recently to the Führer that the
Reich Minister of Finance still maintains the point of view
that confiscation of property of enemies of the People and
State should be made in favor of the Reich and not in favor
of the Reich Gaue. Consequently the Führer has informed me
that he desires the confiscation of such properties to be effected
in favor of the Reich Gau in whose area the confiscated
property is situated, and not in favor of the Reich.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You need not read any more of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: I pass over now to the Jewish persecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution submits, finally, that Schirach authorized,
directed, and participated in anti-Semitic measures. Of course, the
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span>
whole ideology and teaching of the Hitler Youth was predicated
upon the Nazi racial myth. Before the war, Schirach addressed a
meeting of the National Socialist German Students’ League, the
organization he headed from 1929 to 1931. Document 2441-PS is
offered as Exhibit USA-679, an affidavit by Gregor Ziemer. I wish
to read merely from the bottom of Page 95 of the document book
to the end of the first paragraph at the top of Page 96 of the
document book. The deponent Ziemer is referring to a meeting
at Heidelberg, Germany, which he personally attended some time
before the war, at which Baldur von Schirach addressed the Students’
League, which he himself had at one time led.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is this document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: It is an affidavit of Gregor Ziemer:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“He”—meaning Schirach—“declared that the most important
phase of German university life in the Third Reich was the
program of the NSDSTB. He extolled various activities of
the League. He reminded the boys of the service they had
rendered during the Jewish purge. Dramatically he pointed
across the river to the old university town of Heidelberg
where several burnt-out synagogues were mute witnesses of
the efficiency of Heidelberg students. These skeleton buildings
would remain there for centuries as inspiration for future
students, as warning to enemies of the State.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To attempt to visualize the true extent of the fiendish treatment
of Jews under Schirach, we must look to his activities in the Reichsgau
Vienna and to the activities of his assistants, the SS and the
Gestapo, in Vienna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number 1948, Page 63 of your document book, is
offered as Exhibit USA-680. You will note it is on the stationery
of the last Governor of Vienna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Captain Sprecher, I have been reading on
in this Document 2441-PS, on Page 96 of the document book. It
seems to me you ought to read the next three paragraphs on Page 96
from the place where you left off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The second, third, and fourth paragraphs.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: “Even as old Heidelberg Castle was
evidence that Old Germany had been too weak to resist the
invading Frenchmen who destroyed it, so the black remains
of the synagogues would be a perpetual monument reminding
coming generations of the strength of New Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk378'/>
<p class='noindent'>“He reminded the students that there were still countries
which squandered their time and energy with books and
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>
wasteful discussions about abstract topics of philosophy and
metaphysics. Those days were over. New Germany was a
land of action. The other countries were sound asleep.</p>
<hr class='tbk379'/>
<p class='noindent'>“But he was in favor of letting them sleep. The more
soundly they slumbered, the better opportunity for the men
of the Third Reich to prepare for more action. The day
would come when German students of Heidelberg would
take their places side by side with legions of other students
to conquer the world for the ideology of Nazism.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I was about to refer, Your Honors, to Document Number 1948-PS,
which is found at Page 63 of your document book, and which I offer
as Exhibit USA-680. This, you will note, is on the stationery of
the Reich Governor of Vienna, the Reichsstatthalter in Vienna.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 7 November 1940.</p>
<hr class='tbk380'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Subject: Compulsory labor of able-bodied Jews.</p>
<hr class='tbk381'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. Notice: On 5 November 1940 telephone conversation with
Colonel”—Standartenführer—“Huber of the Gestapo. The
Gestapo has received secret directions from the Reich Security
Main Office (RSHA) as to how able-bodied Jews should be
drafted for compulsory labor service. Investigations are
being made at present by the Gestapo to find out how many
able-bodied Jews are still available, in order to make plans
for the contemplated mass projects. It is assumed that there
are not many more Jews available. If some should still be
available, however, the Gestapo has no scruples to use the
Jews even for clearing away the destroyed synagogues.</p>
<hr class='tbk382'/>
<p class='noindent'>“SS Standartenführer Huber will make a report personally to
the Regierungspräsident in this matter.</p>
<hr class='tbk383'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I have reported to the Regierungspräsident accordingly.
The matter should be kept further in mind.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The signature is by Dr. Fischer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I want to call the Court’s attention to the significance of the
title Regierungspräsident. The SS Colonel, you will note, was to
report to the Regierungspräsident. If you will refer back again to
the decree which set up the Reichsgau Vienna, 1939 Reichsgesetzblatt,
Part I, Page 777 (Document 3301-PS), you will find that the
Regierungspräsident was Schirach’s personal representative within
the governmental administration of Vienna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, it seems to us that this Document Number 1948-PS, which
was signed by Fischer, concerning compulsory labor of able-bodied
Jews, answers the argument that persons of the rank of Gauleiter
were ignorant of the atrocities of the Gestapo and the SS in their
own locality. It shows further that even the assistants of the Gau
leaders were informed of the details of the persecution projects
which were afoot at the time.
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Schirach also had concern for, and knowledge of, the housing
shortage in Vienna, which was alleviated for some members of the
alleged master race who succeeded to the houses of the luckless
Jews who were moved into oblivion in Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On December 3, 1940, the conspirator Lammers wrote a letter to
Schirach. It is our Document 1950-PS, Page 64 of your document
book, and it is offered in evidence as Exhibit USA-681. The letter is
very short:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'> December 1940.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>the stationery of the Reich Minister and Chief of the Reich
Chancellery, and it is marked “secret”:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“To the Reich Governor in Vienna, Gauleiter Von Schirach:</p>
<hr class='tbk384'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As Reichsleiter Bormann informs me, the Führer has decided,
after receipt of one of the reports made by you, that the 60,000
Jews still residing in the Reichsgau Vienna will be deported
most rapidly”—that is, still during the war—“to the Government
General, because of the housing shortage prevalent in
Vienna. I have informed the Governor General in Kraków, as
well as the Reichsführer SS, about this decision of the Führer,
and I request you also to take cognizance of it.”—Signed—“Lammers.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As a last piece of illustrative evidence against this youngest
member of the defendants in the dock, I take something from his
own lips, which was published for all Vienna and, indeed, for all
Germany and the world to know, even at that time. It appears in
the Vienna edition of the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>, on the 15th of September
1942, Document 3048-PS, your document book, Page 106. It
is already in evidence as Exhibit USA-274.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like to point out that these words were uttered before
the so-called European Youth League in Vienna in 1942. The
Tribunal will recall that Schirach was still Reich Leader for Youth
Education in the NSDAP at that time:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Every Jew who exerts influence in Europe is a danger to
European culture. If anyone reproaches me with having driven
from this city, which was once the European metropolis of
Jewry, tens of thousands upon tens of thousands of Jews into
the ghetto of the East, I feel myself compelled to reply, ‘I see
in this an action contributing to European culture.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Although Schirach’s principal assistance to the conspiracy was
made in his commission of the German youth to the conspirators’
objectives, he also stands guilty of heinous Crimes against Humanity
as a Party and governmental administrator of high standing, after
the conspiracy had reached its inevitable involvement in wars of
aggression.
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This completes, Your Honors, the presentation on the individual
responsibility of the Defendant Schirach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution will next take up the responsibility of the
Defendant Martin Bormann, and the presentation will be made by
Lieutenant Lambert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Mr. President, as to the various errors made in the
case against Schirach, I shall state my position when the Defense
has its turn. But I should like to take the opportunity now of pointing
out an error in translation in one of the documents. It is in
Document 3352-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is an order of the Reich Chancellery to the subordinate offices,
and this order mentions that the labor offices had to be at the
disposal of the Gauleiter under certain circumstances. In the German
original of this order it reads as follows: “Anregungen und
Wünsche.” Now “Anregungen und Wünsche,” that is.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Which page of the document is it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: I think, Page 512 of Document 3352-PS, on
Page 117 of the document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This German expression “Anregungen und Wünsche” has been
translated by “suggestions” (for “Anregungen”) and “demands” (for
“Wünsche”).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first translation, the translation for “Anregungen,” we consider
to be correct; but the second translation, namely, “demands”
for “Wünsche,” we consider false, because, so far as we know, this
word is “Befehle” or “Forderungen” in German. We should consider
it correct if the English translation “demands” could be translated
by another word, “wishes,” which is an exact translation of the word
“Wünsche.” I do not know whether I have pronounced the word
correctly in English. That is all I have to say for the time being.
Thank you very much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT (to Captain Sprecher): Do you wish to say
anything about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: I think that Dr. Sauter has made a very good
point. I have checked with the translator beside me, Your
Honor, and the German word “Wünsche” has been translated too
strongly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LIEUTENANT THOMAS F. LAMBERT, JR. (Assistant Trial
Counsel for the United States): May it please the Tribunal, the
Prosecution comes now to deal with the Defendant Bormann and
to present the proofs establishing his responsibility for the crimes
set forth in the Indictment. And, if the Tribunal will allow, we
should like to observe on the threshold that because of the absence
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>
of the Defendant Bormann from the dock we believe that we should
make an extra effort to make a solid record in the case against
Bormann, out of fairness to Defense Counsel and for the convenience
of the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I offer the document book supporting this trial address as U.S.
Exhibit JJ, together with the trial brief against the Defendant
Bormann.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Bormann bears a major responsibility for
promoting the accession to power of the Nazi conspirators, the
consolidation of their total power over Germany, and the preparation
for aggressive war set forth in Count One of the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the Record of this Trial the Nazi Party and its Leadership
Corps were the main vehicles of the conspiracy and the fountainhead
of the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, following the flight of the Defendant Hess to Scotland in
May 1941, Bormann became executive chief of the Nazi Party. His
official title was Chief of the Party Chancellery. Before that date
Bormann was chief of staff to the Defendant Hess, the Deputy to
the Führer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By virtue of these two powerful positions—Chief of the Party
Chancellery and Chief of Staff to the Deputy to the Führer—Bormann
stands revealed as a principal architect of the conspiracy.
Subject only—and we stress—subject only to the supreme authority
of Hitler, Bormann engineered and employed the vast powers of
the Party, its agencies, and formations, in furtherance of the Nazi
conspiracy; and he employed the Party to impose the will of the
conspirators upon the German people; and he then directed the
powers of the Party in the drive to dominate Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, the Defendant Bormann is blameworthy for the
multiple crimes of the conspiracy, for the multiple crimes committed
by the Party, its agencies, and the German people, in
furthering the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It might be helpful to give a very brief sketch of the career in
conspiracy of the Defendant Bormann.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bormann began his conspiratorial activities more than 20 years
ago. In 1922, only 22 years of age, he joined the Organization
Rossbach, one of the illegal groups which continued the militaristic
traditions of the German Army and employed terror against the
small struggling pacifist minority in Germany. While he was district
leader for this organization in Mecklenburg, he was arrested and
tried for his part in a political assassination, which, we suggest,
indicates his disposition to use illegal methods to carry out purposes
satisfactory to himself. On 15 May 1924 he was found guilty by the
State Tribunal for the Protection of the Republic and sentenced to
1 year in prison.
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon his release from prison in 1925 Bormann resumed his
subversive activities. He joined the militarist organization “Frontbann,”
and in the same year he joined the Nazi Party and began
his ascent to a prominent position in the conspiracy. In 1927 he
became press chief for the Party Gau of Thuringia. In other words,
relating back to the case against the Leadership Corps, he became
an important staff officer of a Gauleiter. On 1 April 1928 he was
made District Leader (Bezirksleiter) in Thuringia and business
manager for the entire Gau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We come now to a particularly important point involving
Bormann’s tie-up with the SA.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From 15 November 1928 to August 1930 he was on the staff of
the Supreme Command of the SA.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the Tribunal has heard the demonstration of the criminality
of the SA and knows full well that this was a semi-military
organization of young men whose main mission was to get control
of the streets and to impose terror on oppositional elements of the
conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our submission at this stage is that, by virtue of Bormann’s
position on the staff of the Supreme Command of the SA, he shares
responsibility for the illegal activities of the SA in furtherance of
the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In August 1930 Bormann organized the Aid Fund (Hilfskasse) of
the Nazi Party, of which he became head. Through this fund he
collected large sums for the alleged purpose of aiding the families
of Party members who had been killed or injured while fighting
for the Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the Tribunal knows, on 30 January 1933 the conspirators and
their Party took over the Government of Germany. Shortly thereafter,
in July 1933, Bormann was given the number three position
in the Party, that of chief of staff to the Defendant Hess, the
Deputy to the Führer. At the same time he was made a Reichsleiter;
and as the Tribunal knows, that makes him a member of the top
level of the alleged illegal organization, the Leadership Corps of
the Nazi Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In November 1933 he was made a member of the Reichstag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I request the Tribunal to take judicial notice of the authoritative
German publication <span class='it'>The Greater German Reichstag</span>, edition of
1943. The facts which I have recited in the foregoing sketch of
Defendant Bormann’s career are set forth on Page 167 of that
publication, the English translation of which appears in Document
2981-PS of the document book now before the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With respect to Bormann’s conviction for political murder, I
offer in evidence Document 3355-PS, Exhibit USA-682, which is
<span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span>
the affidavit of Dr. Robert M. W. Kempner, and I quote therefrom
briefly as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I, Robert M. W. Kempner, an expert consultant of the War
Department, appeared before the undersigned attesting officer
and, having been duly sworn, stated as follows:</p>
<hr class='tbk385'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In my capacity as Superior Government Counsellor and Chief
Legal Advisor of the pre-Hitler Prussian Police Administration,
I became officially acquainted with the criminal record
of Martin Bormann, identical with the Defendant Martin Bormann
now under indictment before the International Military
Tribunal in Nuremberg, Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk386'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The official criminal record of Martin Bormann contained the
following entry:</p>
<hr class='tbk387'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Bormann, Martin, sentenced on May 15, 1924, by the State
Tribunal for the Protection of the Republic, in Leipzig, Germany,
to 1 year in prison, for having been an accomplice in
the commission of a political murder.”—Signed—“Robert M.
W. Kempner.”—End of quotation.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Lieutenant Lambert, I don’t think it is
necessary for you, when dealing with a document of that sort, to
read the formal parts. If you state the nature of the document and
read the material part, you needn’t deal with the formal parts,
for instance, “I, Robert Kempner, an expert consultant,” and all that.
Do you understand me?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: Thank you very much, Sir, for a very helpful
suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Defendant Hess’ chief of staff, Bormann was responsible for
receiving and channelling up to the Defendant Hess the demands of
the Party in all fields of State action. These demands were then
secured by the Defendant Hess by virtue of his participation in the
legislative process, his power with respect to the appointment and
promotion of government officials, and by virtue of his position in
the Reich Cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I come now, as it seems to us, to an important point, which ties
up the Defendant Bormann with the SD and the Gestapo. As chief
of staff of the Defendant Hess, Bormann took measures to reinforce
the grip of the Gestapo and the SD over the German civil population.
I request the Tribunal to notice judicially a Bormann order of
14 February 1935, set forth in the official publication <span class='it'>Decrees of the
Deputy of the Führer</span>, Edition 1937, Page 257. I quote merely the
pertinent portions of that decree, the English version of which is set
forth in our Document 3237-PS, which reads as follows. That is our
Document 3237-PS.
<span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If it is a document of which we can take
judicial notice, it is sufficient for you to summarize it without
reading it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: I appreciate that, Sir. This quotation is so succinct
and so brief that we perhaps could avoid summarization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, go on.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>LT. LAMBERT: “The Deputy to the Führer expects that Party
offices will now abandon all distrust of the SD and will support
it wholeheartedly in the performance of the difficult tasks
with which it has been entrusted for the protection of the
Movement and our people.</p>
<hr class='tbk388'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Because the work of the SD is primarily to the benefit of
the work of the Party, it is inadmissable that its development
be upset by uncalled-for attacks when individuals fall short
of expectations. On the contrary, it must be wholeheartedly
assisted.”—Signed—“Bormann, Chief of Staff to the Deputy
to the Führer.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is with respect to Bormann’s support of the SD. I deal now
with Bormann’s effort to support the work of the Gestapo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Lieutenant Lambert, wouldn’t it be sufficient
to say that document indicates the support Bormann promised to
the SD?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: I was anxious merely on one point, Sir, that a
document was not in evidence unless it had been quoted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you began by asking us to take judicial
notice of it. If we can take judicial notice of it, it need not be
quoted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: Then, with respect to Bormann’s efforts to
reinforce the grip of the Gestapo, I request the Tribunal to notice
judicially a Bormann order of 3 September 1935, calling on Party
agencies to report to the Gestapo all persons who criticize Nazi
institutions or the Nazi Party. This decree appears in the official Party
publication <span class='it'>Decrees of the Deputy of the Führer</span>, 1937, at Page 190.
The English translation is set forth in our Document 3239-PS. I shall
summarize the effect of this document shortly. In its first paragraph
it refers to a law of 20 December 1934. As the Tribunal will recall,
this law gave the same protection to Party institutions and Party uniforms
as enjoyed by the State; and in the first and second paragraphs
of this decree it is indicated that whenever a case came up
involving malicious or slanderous attack on Party members or the
Nazi Party or its institutions, the Reich Minister of Justice would
consult with the Deputy of the Führer in order to take joint action
against the offenders. Then, in the third paragraph, Bormann gives
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>
his orders to all Party agencies with respect to reporting to the
Gestapo individuals who criticized the Nazi Party or its institutions.
I quote merely the last paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I took down what you said in your
first sentence, which was that the document showed that he was
ordering that a report should be made to the Gestapo on anyone
criticizing the Party. Well, that is sufficient, it seems to me, and
all that you said after is cumulative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: There is, however, one brief point, if I may be
permitted, which I should like to emphasize, about the last
paragraph, because I think it is helpful to the Prosecution’s case
against the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will recall that it asked certain very material
questions with respect to whether the Prosecution’s evidence
involved the rank and file of the Leadership Corps. In the last
paragraph of this decree Bormann instructs the Ortsgruppenleiter—now
that is way down in the Leadership Corps hierarchy under
Kreisleiter and Gauleiter—to report to the Gestapo persons who
criticize Nazi Party institutions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, an important point with respect to the tie-up between
Bormann and the SS. The Tribunal has already received the
evidence establishing the criminality of the SS. In this connection,
I respectfully request the Tribunal to notice judicially the July 1940
issue of <span class='it'>Das Archiv</span>, our Document 3234-PS. On Page 399 of that
publication, under date 21 July 1940, it is stated that the Führer
promoted Defendant Bormann from major general to lieutenant
general in the SS. Accordingly, we respectfully submit that
Bormann is chargeable and jointly responsible for the criminal
activities of the SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the flight of the Defendant Hess to Scotland in May 1941,
the Defendant Bormann succeeded him as head of the Nazi Party
under Hitler, with the title Chief of the Party Chancellery. I
request the Tribunal to take judicial notice of a decree of 24 January
1942, 1942 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, Page 35. In our conception
this is an extremely important decree, because by virtue of it the
participation of the Party in all legislation and in government
appointments and promotions had to be undertaken exclusively by
Bormann. He was to take part in the preparation—and we
emphasize that—as well as the enactment and promulgation of
all Reich laws and enactments; and further, he had to give his
assent to all enactments of the Reich Länder—that is, the
states—as well as all decrees of the Reich governors. All communications
between state and Party officials had to pass through his
hands. And, as a result of this law, we respectfully submit,
<span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span>
Bormann is chargeable for every enactment issued in Germany
after 24 January 1942 which facilitates and furthers the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be helpful, I believe, to point out and to request the
Court to take judicial notice of a decree of 29 May 1941, 1941
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, Page 295 (Document 2099-PS); in this
decree Hitler ordered that Bormann should take over all powers and
all offices formerly held by the Defendant Hess. I request the
Tribunal to take judicial notice of another very important decree,
that of the Ministerial Council for Defense of the Reich, 16 November
1942 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are these documents set out in the document
book?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You haven’t given us the reference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: That is true, Sir. I recall from memory, although
I do not have it in my manuscript, that document, that
important decree of 24 January 1942, is our Document, I believe,
2100-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now request the Tribunal to take judicial notice of the important
decree of the Ministerial Council for Defense of the Reich, dated 16
November 1942, 1942 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, Page 649 (Document
JN-5). Under this decree all Gauleiter, who were under Bormann
by virtue of his position as Chief of the Party Chancellery, were
appointed Reich defense commissars and charged with the co-ordination,
supervision, and management of the aggressive Nazi war effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From then on the Party, under Bormann, became the decisive
force in planning and conducting the aggressive Nazi war economy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 12 April 1943, as is shown in the publication <span class='it'>The Greater
German Reichstag</span>, 1943 edition, Page 167, our Document 2981-PS,
Bormann was appointed Secretary of the Führer, and we submit
that this fact testifies to the intimacy and influence of the Defendant
Bormann with the Führer and enlarges his role in, and responsibility
for, the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now come to the important point of Bormann’s executive
responsibility for the acts of the Volkssturm. I request the Tribunal
to notice judicially a Führer order of 18 October 1944, which was
published in the official <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>, 20 October 1944
edition, in which Hitler appointed Bormann political and organizational
leader of the Volkssturm. This is set forth in our Document
3018-PS. In this decree Himmler is made the military leader of the
Volkssturm, but the organizational and political leadership is
entrusted to Bormann. The Tribunal will know that the Volkssturm
was an organization consisting of all German males between 16 and
60. By virtue of his leadership of the Volkssturm Bormann was
<span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span>
instrumental in needlessly prolonging the war, with a consequential
destruction of the German and the European economy and a loss
of life and destruction of property.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We come now to deal with the responsibility of the Defendant
Bormann with respect to persecution of the Church. The Defendant
Bormann authorized, directed, and participated in measures involving
the persecution of the Christian Church. The Tribunal, of course,
has heard much in this proceeding concerning the acts of the
conspiracy involving the persecution of the Church. We have no
desire now to rehash that evidence. We are interested in one thing
alone, and that is nailing on the Defendant Bormann his responsibility,
his personal, individual responsibility, for the persecution of
the Church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall now present the proofs showing the responsibility of Bormann
with respect to such persecution of the Christian churches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bormann was among the most relentless enemies of the Christian
Church and Christian clergy in Germany and in German-occupied
Europe. I refer the Tribunal, without quoting therefrom, to Document
D-75, previously introduced in evidence as Exhibit Number
USA-348, which contains a copy of the secret Bormann decree of
6 June 1941 entitled “The Relationship of National Socialism to
Christianity.” In this decree, as the Tribunal will well recall, Bormann
bluntly declared that National Socialism and Christianity were
incompatible, and he indicated that the ultimate aim of the conspirators
was to assure the elimination of Christianity itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I next refer the Tribunal, without quotation, to Document 098-PS,
previously put in as Exhibit Number USA-350. This is a letter from
the Defendant Bormann to the Defendant Rosenberg, dated
22 February 1940, in which Bormann reaffirms the incompatibility
of Christianity and National Socialism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, in furtherance of the conspirators’ aim to undermine the
Christian churches, Bormann took measures to eliminate the
influence of the Christian Church from within the Nazi Party and its
formations. I now offer in evidence Document 113-PS, as Exhibit
USA-683. This is an order of the Defendant Bormann, dated
27 July 1938, issued as chief of staff to the Deputy of the Führer,
Hess, which prohibits clergymen from holding Party offices. I shall
not take the time of the Tribunal to spread this quotation upon the
Record. The point of it is, as indicated, that Bormann issued an
order forbidding the appointment of clergymen to Party positions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps this would be a good time to break
off for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>
<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: May it please the Tribunal, we are dealing with
the efforts of the Defendant Bormann to expel and exorcise from
the Party all church and religious influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I offer in evidence Document 838-PS, as Exhibit USA-684. I shall
not burden the Record with extensive quotation from this exhibit,
but merely point out that this is a copy of a Bormann decree dated
3 June 1939, which laid it down that followers of Christian Science
should be excluded from the Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attention of the Tribunal is next invited to Document 840-PS,
previously introduced in evidence as Exhibit USA-355. The Tribunal
will recall that this was a Bormann decree of 14 July 1939, referring
with approval to an earlier Bormann decree of 9 February 1937 in
which the Defendant Bormann ruled that in the future all Party
members who entered the clergy or who undertook the study of
theology were to be expelled from the Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I next offer in evidence Document 107-PS, Exhibit USA-351. This
is a circular directive of the Defendant Bormann, dated 17 June
1938, addressed to all Reichsleiter and Gauleiter—top leaders of the
Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party—transmitting a copy of directions
relating to the non-participation of the Reich Labor Service in
religious celebrations. The Reich Labor Service, the Tribunal will
recall, compulsorily incorporated all Germans within its organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRIEDRICH BERGOLD (Counsel for Defendant Bormann):
The member of the Prosecution has just submitted a number of
documents, in which he proves that, on the suggestion of Bormann,
members of the Christian religion were to be excluded from the
Party or from certain organizations. I beg the High Tribunal to allow
the member of the Prosecution to explain to me how and why this
activity, that is, the exclusion of Christians from the Party, can be
a War Crime. I cannot gather this evidence from the trial brief.
The Party is described as criminal—as a conspiracy. Is it a crime
to exclude certain people from membership in a criminal conspiracy?
Is that considered a crime? How and why is the exclusion of certain
members from the Party a crime?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Counsel will answer you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: If the Tribunal will willingly accommodate argument
at this stage, we find that the question.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Only short argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: Yes, Sir.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. admits of a short, and, as it seems
to us, an easy answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The point we are now trying to prove—and evidence is abounding
on it—is that Bormann had a hatred and an enmity and took oppositional
measures towards the Christian Church. The Party was the
repository of political power in Germany. To have power one had
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span>
to be in the Party or subject to its favor. By his efforts, concerted,
continuing, and consistent, to exclude clergymen, theological
students, or any persons sympathetic to the Christian religion, Bormann
could not have chosen a clearer method of showing and
demonstrating his hatred and his distrust of the Christian religion
and those who supported it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Counsel for Bormann can present his argument
upon this subject at a later stage. The documents appear to
the Tribunal to be relevant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: With the Tribunal’s permission, I had just put in
Document 107-PS and pointed out that it transmitted directions
relating to the non-participation of the Reich Labor Service in
religious celebrations. I quote merely the fourth and fifth paragraphs
of Page 1 of the English translation of Document 107-PS, which reads
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“All religious discussion is forbidden in the Reich Labor
Service because it disturbs the comrade-like union of all
working men and women.</p>
<hr class='tbk389'/>
<p class='noindent'>“For this reason also any participation of the Reich Labor
Service in church, that is, confessional, services and celebrations
is impossible.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The attention of the Tribunal is next invited to Document 070-PS,
previously put in as Exhibit USA-349. The Tribunal will recall that
this was a letter from Bormann’s office to the Defendant Rosenberg,
dated 25 April 1941, in which Bormann declared that he had achieved
progressive success in reducing and abolishing religious services in
schools and in replacing Christian prayers with National Socialist
mottoes and rituals. In this letter Bormann also proposed a Nazified
morning service in the schools in place of the existing confession and
morning service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his concerted efforts to undermine and subvert the Christian
churches, Bormann authorized, directed, and participated in
measures leading to the closing, reduction, and suppression of
theological schools, faculties, and institutions. The attention of the
Tribunal is invited to Document 116-PS, Exhibit Number USA-685,
which I offer in evidence. This is a letter from the Defendant Bormann
to the Defendant Rosenberg, dated 24 January 1939, enclosing
for Rosenberg’s cognizance a copy of Bormann’s letter to the Reich
Minister for Science, Education, and Popular Culture. In the
enclosed letter Bormann informs the Minister as to the Party’s
position in favor of restricting and suppressing theological faculties.
Bormann states that, owing to war conditions, it had become
necessary to reorganize the German high schools and, in view of this
situation, he requested the Minister to restrict and suppress certain
theological faculties.
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I now quote from the first paragraph on Page 3 of the English
translation of Document 116-PS, which reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I therefore should like to see you put the theological faculties
under substantial limitations, where, for the above reasons,
they cannot be entirely eliminated. This will apply not only
to the theological faculties at universities but also to the
various state institutions which, as seminaries having no
affiliation with any university, still exist in many places.</p>
<hr class='tbk390'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I request that no express explanations be given to churches
or other institutions and that public announcement of these
measures be avoided. Complaints and the like are to be
answered if at all, with the explanation that these measures
are carried out in the course of planned economy and that the
same is happening to other faculties.</p>
<hr class='tbk391'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I would be glad if the professorial chairs thus made vacant
could then be turned over especially to those fields of research
newly created in recent years, such as racial research,
archeology, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, Martin Bormann.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In our submission, what this document comes to is a request from
Bormann to this effect: Please close down the religious faculties and
substitute in their place Nazi faculties and university chairs with
the mission of investigating racism, cultism, Nazi archeology. This
sort of thing was done in the Hohe Schule, as was so clearly
demonstrated in the Prosecution’s case against the plundering
activities of the Einsatzstab Rosenberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attention of the Tribunal is next invited to Document 122-PS,
previously put in as Exhibit Number USA-362. The Tribunal will
recall that 122-PS is a letter from the Defendant Bormann to the
Defendant Rosenberg, dated 17 April 1939, transmitting to Rosenberg
a photostatic copy of the plan of the Reich Minister of Science,
Education, and Popular Culture for the combining and dissolving of
certain specified theological faculties. In his letter of transmittal
Bormann requested Rosenberg to take “cognizance and prompt
action” with respect to the proposed suppression of religious
institutions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I next offer in evidence Document 123-PS, Exhibit USA-686. This
is a confidential letter from the Defendant Bormann to the Minister
of Education, dated 23 June 1939, in which Bormann sets forth the
Party’s decision to order the suppression of numerous theological
faculties and religious institutions. The Tribunal will note that the
letter lists 19 separate religious institutions with respect to which
Bormann ordered dissolution or restriction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After directing the action to be taken by the Minister in connection
with the various theological faculties, Bormann stated as follows—and
<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span>
I quote from the next to last paragraph of Page 3 of the
English translation of Document 123-PS:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the above I have informed you of the Party’s wishes, after
thorough investigation of the matter with all Party offices. I
should be grateful if you would initiate the necessary measures
as quickly as possible. With regard to the great political
significance which every single case of such a consolidation will
have for the Gau concerned, I ask you to take these measures
and particularly to fix dates for them always in agreement
with me.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I next offer in evidence, without quotation, Document 131-PS as
Exhibit USA-687. In summary, without quotation therefrom, this
is a letter from the Defendant Bormann to the Defendant Rosenberg,
dated 12 December 1939, relating to the suppression of seven
professorships in the near-by University of Munich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I deal briefly with the responsibility of Bormann for the
confiscation of religious property and cultural property. Bormann
used his paramount power and position to cause the confiscation of
religious property and to subject the Christian churches and clergy
to a discriminatory legal regime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I offer in evidence Document 099-PS, Exhibit USA-688. This is
a copy of a letter from Bormann to the Reich Minister for Finance,
dated 19 January 1940, in which Bormann demanded a great
increase in the special war tax imposed on the churches. I quote
from the first two paragraphs of Page 2 of the English translation of
Document 099-PS, which read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As it has been reported to me, the war contribution of the
churches for the 3-month period beginning 1 November 1939
has been tentatively set at RM 1,800,000 per month, of which
RM 1 million are to be paid by the Protestant Church, and
RM 800,000 by the Catholic Church.</p>
<hr class='tbk392'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The fixing of such a low amount has surprised me. I see from
numerous reports that political communities are obliged to
raise such a large war contribution that the performance of
their tasks—some of them very important; for example, in
the field of public welfare—is endangered. In view of this,
a higher quota also from the churches appears to me to be
absolutely justified.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The question may arise: Of what criminal effect is it to demand
larger taxes from church institutions? As to this demand of Bormann’s
taken by itself, the Prosecution would not suggest that it
had criminal effect, but when viewed within the larger frame of
Bormann’s demonstrated hostility to the Christian Church and his
efforts not merely to circumscribe but to eliminate it, we suggest
that this document has probative value in showing Bormann’s
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>
hostility and his concrete measures to effectuate that hostility against
the Christian churches and clergy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I next refer the Tribunal to Document 089-PS, previously put
in as Exhibit Number USA-360. The Tribunal will recall that this
was a letter from Bormann to Reichsleiter Amann, dated 8 March
1940, in which Bormann instructed Amann, Reichsleiter of the
Press, to make a sharper restriction in paper distribution against
religious writings in favor of publications more acceptable to the
Nazi ideology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I next offer in evidence Document 066-PS, as Exhibit USA-689.
This is a letter from the Defendant Bormann to the Defendant
Rosenberg, dated 24 June 1940, transmitting a draft of a proposed
discriminatory church law for Danzig and West Prussia. This decree
is a direct abridgment of religious freedom, for in Paragraph 1—I
do not quote, but briefly and rapidly summarize—the approval of
the Reich deputy for Danzig and West Prussia is required as a condition
for the legal competence of all religious organizations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 3 of the decree suspended all claims of religious
organizations and congregations to state or municipal subsidies and
prohibited religious organizations from exercising their right of
collecting dues without the approval of the Reich deputy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Paragraph 5 of the decree the acquisition of property by
religious organizations was made subject to the approval of the
Reich deputy. All credit rights acquired by religious organizations
prior to 1 January 1940 were required to be ratified by the Reich
Deputy in order to become actionable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now offer in evidence Document 1600-PS, Exhibit USA-690.
This comprises correspondence of Bormann during 1940 and 1941
relating to the confiscation of religious art treasures. I quote the
text of the second letter set forth on Page 1 of the English translation
of Document 1600-PS, which is a letter from the Defendant
Bormann to Dr. Posse of the State Picture Gallery in Dresden,
dated 16 January 1941, which reads as follows, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Dear Dr. Posse:</p>
<hr class='tbk393'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Enclosed herewith I am sending you the pictures of the altar
from the convent in Hohenfurth near Krumau. The convent
and its entire property will be confiscated in the immediate
future because of the subversive attitude of its inmates toward
the State.</p>
<hr class='tbk394'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It would be up to you to decide whether the pictures are to
remain in the convent at Hohenfurth or are to be transferred
to the museum at Linz after its completion.</p>
<hr class='tbk395'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I shall await your opinion in the matter. Bormann.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal may know that, in what is described as Hitler’s
last will and testament, he makes a bequest of all the art treasures
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>
he had in the museum at Linz, and from a legal point of view he
uses the euphemism “art treasures which I have bought.” This
document, on its face, suggests how at least certain of the properties,
the art treasures in the museum at Linz, were acquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, as the war drew increasing numbers of German youth
into the Armed Forces, the Defendant Bormann took measures to
exclude and exorcise all religious influence from the troops. The
attention of the Tribunal is invited to Document 101-PS, previously
put in as Exhibit Number USA-361. The Tribunal will recall that
this is a letter from the Defendant Bormann, dated 17 January 1940,
in which Bormann pronounced the Party’s opposition to the circulation
of religious literature to the members of the German Armed
Forces. In this letter Bormann stated that if the influence of the
church upon the troops was to be effectively fought, this could only
be done by producing, in the shortest possible time, a large amount
of Nazi pamphlets and publications.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now offer in evidence Document 100-PS, as Exhibit Number
USA-691. This is a letter from the Defendant Bormann to Rosenberg,
dated 18 January 1940, in which Bormann declares that the
publication of Nazi literature for army recruits as a counter measure
to the circulation of religious writings was the “most essential
demand of the hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I forbear quoting from that document. Its substance is indicated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now request the Tribunal to notice judicially the authoritative
Nazi publication entitled <span class='it'>Decrees of the Deputy of the Führer</span>,
edition of 1937; and I quote from Page 235 of this volume the
pertinent and important decree issued by the Defendant Bormann
to the Commissioner of the Party Directorate, dated 7 January 1936,
the English version of which is set forth in the English translation
of our Document 3246-PS. In this one sentence Bormann aims and
directs the terror of the Gestapo against dissident church members
who crossed the conspirators, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“If parish priests or other subordinate Roman Catholic leaders
adopt an attitude of hostility toward the State or Party, it shall
be reported to the Secret State Police”—Gestapo—“through
official channels.”—Signed—“Bormann.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>By leave of the Tribunal, I come now to deal with the responsibility
of the Defendant Bormann for the persecution of the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, the Prosecution seeks not to rehash the copious evidence
in the Record on the persecution of the Jews but rather to limit
itself to evidence fastening on the Defendant Bormann his individual
responsibility for the persecution of the Jews. Bormann shares the
deep guilt of the Nazi conspirators for their odious program in the
persecution of the Jews. It was the Defendant Bormann, we would
<span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>
note, who was charged by Hitler with the transmission and implementation
of the Führer’s orders for the liquidation of the so-called
Jewish problem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following the Party-planned and Party-directed program of 8
and 9 November 1938, in the course of which a large number of
Jews were killed and harmed, Jewish shops pillaged and wrecked,
and synagogues set ablaze all over the Reich, the Defendant Bormann,
on orders from Hitler, instructed the Defendant Göring to
proceed to the “final settlement of the Jewish question” in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attention of the Tribunal is invited to Document 1816-PS,
previously put in as Exhibit USA-261. The Tribunal is well
acquainted with this document. It has frequently been referred to.
The Tribunal knows that Document 1816-PS is the minutes of a
conference on the Jewish question, held under the direction of
Göring on the 12th of November 1938. 1 quote only the first sentence
of Document 1816-PS, which fastens the responsibility upon Bormann
and which reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Göring: ‘Gentlemen, today’s meeting is of a decisive nature.
I have received a letter written on the Führer’s orders by the
Chief of Staff of the Führer’s Deputy, Bormann, requesting
that the Jewish question be now, once and for all, co-ordinated
and solved in one way or another.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal is well aware of the proposals, the discussions, and
the actions taken in this conference that constituted the so-called
“settlement of the Jewish question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result of this conference a series of anti-Jewish decrees
and measures were issued and adopted by the Nazi conspirators.
I offer in evidence Document 069-PS, Exhibit USA-589. This is a
decree of Bormann, dated 17 January 1939, in which Bormann
demands compliance with the new anti-Jewish regulations stemming
and flowing from the Göring conference just referred to, under
which Jews were denied access to housing, travel, and other
facilities of ordinary life. I quote the Bormann order, which
appears at Page 1 of the English translation of Document 069-PS,
which reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“According to a report of General Field Marshal Göring, the
Führer has made some basic decisions regarding the Jewish
question. The decisions are brought to your attention in
the enclosure. Strict compliance with these directives is
requested.”—Signed—“Bormann.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the interests of expediting the proceedings, I shall resist the
temptation to quote extensively from the enclosed order in
Bormann’s letter of transmittal. In effect, the crux of it is that
Jews are denied sleeping compartments in trains, the right to give
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>
their trade to certain hotels in Berlin, Munich, Nuremberg, Augsburg,
and the like. They are banned and excluded from swimming
pools, certain public squares, resort towns, mineral baths, and the
like. The stigma, the degradation, and the inconvenience in the
ordinary affairs of life promoted by this decree are plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I next request the Tribunal to notice judicially the decree of
12 November 1938, 1938 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, Page 1580
(Document JN-6), quite familiar to this Tribunal, for it was the
decree which excluded Jews from economic life. This decree forbade
Jews to operate retail shops, and it was a decree which went
far to eliminate Jews from economic life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Bormann also acted through other state agencies to wipe
out the economic existence of large sections of the Jewish population.
In that respect I request the Tribunal to notice judicially the
authoritative Nazi publication entitled <span class='it'>Decrees of the Deputy of
the Führer</span>, edition of 1937, our Document 3240-PS. At Page 383
of this publication there appears a decree of the Defendant Bormann,
dated 8 January 1937, reproducing an order of the Defendant
Frick, issued at Bormann’s instigation, denying financial assistance
to government employees who employed the services of
Jewish doctors, lawyers, pharmacists, morticians, and other professional
classes. I shall forbear from quoting the text of that decree.
Its substance is as given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If it please the Tribunal, for the benefit of the translators I
shall continue reading from Page 25 of the manuscript.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the outbreak of war the anti-Jewish measures increased
in intensity and brutality. Thus, the Defendant Bormann participated
in the arrangements for the deportation to Poland of 60,000
Jewish inhabitants of Vienna, in co-operation with the SS and the
Gestapo. I have no doubt that the Tribunal received this document
in connection with the case against Von Schirach; it is our
Document 1950-PS, and on its face it points out, and Lammers says:
Bormann has informed Von Schirach of your proposal to bring
about the deportations. I limit myself to pointing out that single,
solitary fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Bormann succeeded the Defendant Hess as Chief of the
Party Chancellery, he used his vast powers in such a way that
he was a prime mover in the program of starvation, degradation,
spoliation, and extermination of the Jews—and we use those terms
advisedly—subject to the Draconian rule of the conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I request the Tribunal to notice judicially the decree of 31 May
1941, 1941 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, Page 297, which was signed
by the Defendant Bormann and which extends the discriminatory
Nuremberg laws into the annexed Eastern territories. I request
the Tribunal to notice judicially the 11th ordinance under the
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>
Reich citizenship law of 25 November 1941, 1941 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, Page 722, signed by Defendant Bormann, which ordered
the confiscation of the property of all Jews who had left Germany
or who had been deported.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I request the Tribunal to notice judicially an order of Bormann’s
dated 23 October 1941.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You have not given us the PS numbers of
either the decree of 31 of May 1941 or the one after that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: I confess dereliction of duty there. These
decrees, in translated form, are all in the document book. I do
not have, in my manuscript, their PS citation. However, in the
brief now filed with or soon to be delivered to the Tribunal, these
decrees are given with their PS numbers opposite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: 3354-PS and 3241-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: That is very good of you, Sir. Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I request the Tribunal to notice judicially an order of the
Defendant Bormann, dated 23 October 1942, Volume II of the
publication <span class='it'>Decrees, Regulations, Announcements</span>, Page 147. This
is our document, I rejoice to be able to say, 3243-PS, which announces
a Ministry of Food decree, issued at Bormann’s instigation,
which deprived Jews of many essential food items, all special sickness
and pregnancy rations for expectant mothers and ordered
confiscation of food parcels sent to the beleaguered Jews from the
sympathetic outside world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now request the Tribunal to notice judicially the 13th ordinance
under the Reich citizenship law of 1 July 1943, 1943 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, Page 372, signed by the Defendant Bormann, under
which all Jews were completely withdrawn from the protection
of the ordinary courts and handed over to the exclusive jurisdiction
of Himmler’s police. This is our Document 1422-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With leave of the Tribunal, we respectfully request the opportunity
to underline the significance of that decree. In a society
which desires to live under the rule of law, men are judged only
after appearance before, and adjudication by, a court of law. The
effect of this decree was to remove all alleged Jewish offenders
from the jurisdiction of the courts of law and to turn them over
to the police. The police were to have jurisdiction over alleged
Jewish offenders, not the tribunal of law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of this law was soon forthcoming, a result for which
the Defendant Bormann shares the responsibility. On July 3, 1943,
Himmler issued a decree, our Document 3085-PS, 1943 <span class='it'>Ministry
of Interior Gazette</span>, Page 1085. I respectfully request the Tribunal
to take judicial notice of this decree, which charged the Himmler
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span>
police and Gestapo with the execution of the foregoing ordinance
closing the courts to the Jews and entrusting them to Himmler’s
police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, with respect to Bormann’s responsibility for the persecution
of the Jews, I request the Tribunal to notice judicially a
decree of Bormann’s, dated 9 October 1942, Volume II, <span class='it'>Decrees,
Regulations, Announcements</span>, Pages 131, 132. It declared that the
problem of eliminating forever millions of Jews from Greater
German territory could no longer be solved by emigration merely,
but only by the application of ruthless force in special camps in
the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): What are you referring to there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: That, Sir, is Document 3244-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had desired at the outset, Sir, to quote this decree in full
as an irrefutable answer to a question put by Defense Counsel
some days ago in cross-examination, as to whether or not anti-Semitic
policies of the conspirators were the policies merely of
certain demented or deviational members of the conspiracy and
not the concerted, settled policy of the conspiracy itself. Time
does not permit the full quotation of this decree, but with the
indulgence of the Tribunal, if I may offer the essence of this decree
in a brief sentence or two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bormann starts out in this decree by saying: Recently rumors
have been stimulated throughout the Reich as to “ ‘violent things’
we are doing with respect to the Jews.” These rumors are being
brought back to the Reich by our returning soldiers who have eye-witnessed
them in the East. If we are to combat the effect of
these rumors, then our attitude, as I now outline it to you officially,
must be communicated to the German civil population. Bormann
then reviews what he terms “the two-thousand-year-old struggle
against Judaism,” and he divides the Party’s program into two
spheres: the first, the effort of the Party and the conspirators
to excommunicate and expel the Jews from the economic and
social life of Germany. Then he adds: When we started rolling
with our war, this measure by itself was not enough; we had to
resort to forced emigration and set up our camps in the East.
He then goes on to say that: As our armies have advanced in the
East, we have overrun the lands to which we have sent the Jews,
and now these emigration measures, our second proposal, are no
longer sufficient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he comes to the proposal, the considered proposal of himself
and the Party Chancellery: We must transport these Jews
eastward and farther eastward and place them in special camps
for forced labor. I quote now merely the last sentence of Bormann’s
decree:
<span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It lies in the very nature of the matter that these problems,
which in part are very difficult, can be solved only with ruthless
severity in the interest of the final security of our
people.”—Bormann.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>With leave of the Tribunal, I come now to deal.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is it signed by Bormann? It does not appear
to be. I thought you said, “Bormann.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: That is what I said, true, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Tribunal will refer, as it has, to Document 3244-PS, it
is clear that this is a Bormann decree, issued from the Office of the
Deputy to the Führer. It is true in this translation of the decree,
Sir, Bormann’s name is not affixed; but in the original volume it
is very clear that this is a decree of Bormann’s, issued from the
Party Chancellery. The Prosecution so assures the Tribunal and
accepts responsibility for that submission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With leave of the Tribunal, I now come to deal with the
responsibility of the Defendant Bormann for overt acts, for the
commission and planning of a wide variety of crimes in furtherance
of the conspiracy. The Tribunal knows the vast powers that
Bormann possessed; that has already been put in evidence. Our
point is that he used these vast powers, buttressed by his position as
secretary to the Führer attending all the conferences at the Führer’s
headquarters, in the planning, the authorization, and the participation
in overt acts denominated War Crimes and Crimes against
Humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attention of the Tribunal is invited to Document L-221,
previously put in as Exhibit USA-317. The Tribunal knows that
this document is a comprehensive report, dated 16 July 1941, made
by the Defendant Bormann just 3 weeks after the invasion
of the territory of the Soviet Union by Germany. It is
a report of a 20-hour conference at Hitler’s field headquarters with
the Defendants Göring, Rosenberg, Keitel, and with Reich Minister
Lammers. This conference resulted in the adoption of detailed
plans and directives for the enslavement, depopulation, Germanization,
and annexation of extensive territories in the Soviet Union
and other countries of eastern Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his report on this conference, set forth in Document L-221,
Bormann included numerous proposals of his own for the execution
of these plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later the Defendant Bormann took a prominent part in implementing
the conspiratorial program. The attention of the Tribunal
is invited to Document 072-PS, previously put in as Exhibit
USA-357. The Tribunal will recall that this is a letter from the
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span>
Defendant Bormann to the Defendant Rosenberg, dated 19 April
1941, dealing with the confiscation of cultural property in the East.
I quote merely the last two paragraphs of the English translation
of Document 072-PS, which reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Führer emphasized that in the Balkans the use of
your experts”—I parenthetically insert that that is the experts
of the Einsatzstab Rosenberg organization, the plundering
organization—“the use of your experts would not be necessary,
since there were no art objects to be confiscated. In
Belgrade, only the collection of Prince Paul existed, which
would be returned to him completely. The remaining material
of the lodges, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, would be seized by the men of SS
Gruppenführer Heydrich.</p>
<hr class='tbk396'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The libraries and art objects of the monasteries confiscated
in the Reich were to remain for the time being in these
monasteries, insofar as the Gauleiter had not determined
otherwise. After the war, a careful examination of the stock
could be undertaken. Under no circumstances, however,
should a centralization of all the libraries be undertaken
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”—Signed—“Bormann.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now offer in evidence Document 061-PS, Exhibit USA-692.
This is a secret letter from Bormann, dated 11 January 1944, in
which Bormann discloses—and we stress this, very important as
it seems to us—the existence of large-scale operations to drain off
commodities from German-occupied Europe for delivery to the
bombed-out population in Germany. The Tribunal knows that the
Hague Regulations and the laws of war permit the requisitioning
of goods and services only for the use of the Army of Occupation
and for the needs of the administration of the area. This proposal
and this action represent the requisitioning of materials in occupied
areas for the use of the folk at home—of the home front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now quote the first two paragraphs of the English translation—Bormann’s
letter of 11 January 1944, set forth in the English
translation of our Document 061-PS, which reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Since the supply of textiles and household goods for the
bombed population is becoming increasingly difficult, the
proposition was made repeatedly to effect purchases in the
occupied territories in greater proportions. Various Gauleiter
proposed to let these purchases be handled by suitable private
merchants who know these districts and have corresponding
connections.</p>
<hr class='tbk397'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I have brought these proposals to the attention of the Reich
Minister of Economics and am quoting his reply of 16 December
1943 on account of its fundamental importance:
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk398'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘I consider it an especially important task to make use of the
economic power of the occupied territories for the Reich.
You are aware of the fact that, since the occupation of the
Western territories, the buying out of these countries has
been effected to the greatest extent possible. Raw materials,
semi-finished products, and stocks in finished goods have been
rolling into Germany for months; valuable machines were
sent to our armaments industry. Everything was done at
that time to increase our armament potentialities. Later on,
the shipments of these important economic goods were
replaced by the so-called transfer of orders from industry
to industry.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I shall end the quotation there. The rest is not material to the
point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of the war—and this is of utmost importance in
the view of the Prosecution.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is it clear that that was confiscation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: It was not suggested, Sir, that this was confiscation.
Our point was that the Hague regulations allow requisitions
in return for payment only for the needs of the army of occupation
and for the needs of administration of the occupied area.
This represents, as it seems to us, a requisitioning program for the
needs of the home front. It is on that point that we offer it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We come now to what the Prosecution considers a most important
point against the Defendant Bormann. In the course of the war
Bormann issued a series of orders establishing Party jurisdiction
over the treatment of prisoners of war, especially when employed
as forced labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal knows that, under the Geneva Convention of 1929
relating to prisoners of war, prisoners of war are the captives, not
of the troops who take them or even of the army which captures
them, but of the capturing power; and it is the capturing power
which has jurisdiction over and responsibility for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the series of decrees now to be put in, Bormann asserts and
establishes Nazi Party jurisdiction over Allied prisoners of war.
In the exercise of that Party jurisdiction he called for excessively
harsh and brutal treatment of Allied prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now offer in evidence Document 232-PS as Exhibit USA-693.
This is a decree of the Defendant Bormann, dated 13 September
1944, addressed—will the Tribunal please note—to all Reichsleiter,
Gauleiter, and Kreisleiter, and leaders of the Nazi affiliated organizations—numerous
levels, that is, of the Leadership Corps of the
Nazi Party—a decree establishing Nazi Party jurisdiction over the
use of prisoners of war for forced labor.
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I quote the first three paragraphs of Bormann’s order, set forth
on Page 1 of the English translation of Document 232-PS, which
reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The regulations valid until now on the treatment of prisoners
of war and the tasks of the guard units are no longer justified
in view of the demands of the total war effort.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Prosecution would intrude to ask the question: Since when
do the exigencies of the war effort repeal or modify the provisions
of international law?</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Therefore, the OKW, on my suggestion issued the regulation,
a copy of which is enclosed.</p>
<hr class='tbk399'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The following observations are made on its contents:</p>
<hr class='tbk400'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. The understanding exists between the Chief of the
Supreme Command of the Armed Forces and myself that
the co-operation of the Party in the commitment of prisoners
of war is inevitable. Therefore, the officers assigned to
the prisoner-of-war organization have been instructed to co-operate
most closely with the Hoheitsträger. The commandants
of the prisoner-of-war camps have immediately to detail
liaison officers to the Kreisleiter.</p>
<hr class='tbk401'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Thus the opportunity will be afforded the Hoheitsträger to
alleviate existing difficulties locally, to exercise influence on
the behavior of guards units”—and this is the point we
underline—“and better to assimilate the commitment of
prisoners of war to the political and economic demands.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Will the Tribunal permit me to observe that on the face of
this order, addressed to Reichsleiter, Gauleiter, and Kreisleiter,
and so to the officials of the Leadership Corps, in the terms of
the order itself Hoheitsträger are referred to as co-operating media
in this scheme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal has graciously given me an opportunity to observe
that this decree is addressed to Reichsleiter, Gauleiter, Kreisleiter,
and to the leaders of the affiliated and controlled Nazi organizations.
As the Tribunal knows, within the Leadership Corps of
the Nazi Party the Kreisleiter is a pretty low level. That is a
county leader. On the face of the decree itself the co-operation
of the Hoheitsträger is directed—and the Tribunal knows, under
the evidence presented against the Leadership Corps, that Hoheitsträger
range all the way from the Reichsleiter on the top—down
to and including the 500,000 or so Blockleiter implicated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I next offer in evidence Document D-163 as Exhibit USA-694.
This is a letter of the Defendant Bormann, dated 5 November 1941,
addressed—the Tribunal will please note—to all Reichsleiter, Gauleiter,
and Kreisleiter (the last just mere county leaders), transmitting
to these officials of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span>
the instructions of the Reich Minister of the Interior prohibiting
decent burials with religious ceremonies for Russian prisoners of
war. I quote the pertinent portions of these instructions, beginning
with the next to the last sentence of Page 1 of the English translation
of D-163, which reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“To save costs, service departments of the Army will generally
be contacted regarding transport of corpses (furnishing of
vehicles) whenever possible. No coffins will be indented for
the transfer and burial. The body will be completely enveloped
with strong paper (if possible, oil, tar, asphalt paper)
or other suitable material. Transfer and burial is to be
carried out unobtrusively. If a number of corpses have to be
disposed of, the burial will be carried out in a communal
grave. In this case, the bodies will be buried side by side
(not on top of each other) and in accordance with the local
custom regarding depth of graves. Where a graveyard is the
place of burial a distant part will be chosen.</p>
<hr class='tbk402'/>
<p class='noindent'>“No”—we repeat—“No burial ceremony or decoration of
graves will be allowed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now offer in evidence Document 228-PS, Exhibit USA-695.
This is a Bormann circular, dated 25 November 1943, issued from
the headquarters of the Führer, demanding harsher treatment of
prisoners of war and the increased exploitation of their manpower.
I now quote the Bormann circular which is set forth on Page 1
of the English translation of Document 228-PS, which reads as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Individual Gau administrations often refer in reports to
a too indulgent treatment of prisoners of war on the part
of the guard personnel. In many places, according to these
reports, the guarding authorities have even developed into
protectors and caretakers of the prisoners of war.</p>
<hr class='tbk403'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I informed the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces
of these reports, with the comment that the productive
German working population absolutely cannot understand it
if, in a time when the German people is fighting for existence
or nonexistence, prisoners of war—hence our enemies—are
leading a better life than the German working man and
that it is an urgent duty of every German who has to do
with prisoners of war, to bring about a complete utilization
of their manpower.</p>
<hr class='tbk404'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The chief of prisoner-of-war affairs in the Supreme Command
of the Armed Forces has now given the unequivocal order,
attached hereto in copy form, to the commanders of prisoners
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>
of war in the military districts. I request that this order be
brought orally to the attention of all Party office holders in
the appropriate manner.</p>
<hr class='tbk405'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In case that in the future, complaints about unsuitable treatment
of prisoners of war still come to light, they are to be
immediately communicated to the commanders of the prisoners
of war with a reference to the attached order.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will note, of course, that on the face of the
decree Bormann instructs that these orders be communicated orally
to all Party officials and that surely must include the members
of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Speaking for myself, I don’t see anything
particularly wrong in that communication.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: On that point, Sir, we submit that if you take
a document which says, “We wish to utilize all the labor power
of prisoners of war in our control possible and to get this result
by suitable means,” probably it tends to appear unexceptional.
But viewing this document in relation to the other evidence in,
and to be presented, which show a concerted and settled policy by
Bormann and his co-conspirators to.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, it isn’t necessary to argue it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attention of the Tribunal is invited to Document 656-PS,
previously put in as Exhibit USA-339. The Tribunal will recall
that this is a secret Bormann circular transmitting instructions of
the Nazi High Command of 29 January 1943, providing for the
enforcement of labor demands on Allied prisoners of war through
the use of weapons and corporal punishment. I quote a brief
excerpt from these instructions, beginning with the third sentence
of the third numbered paragraph of Page 2 of the English translation
of Document 656-PS, which reads as follows; and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Should the prisoner of war not fulfill his order, then he
has”—that is the guard unit, the guard personnel—“then he
has, in the case of very exceptional need and extreme danger,
the right to force obedience with weapons, if he has no other
means. He may use the weapon insofar as this is necessary
to attain his goal. If the assistant guard is not armed,
then he is authorized in forcing obedience by other appropriate
means.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal knows that, under the Geneva Prisoners-of-War
Convention of 1929, when prisoners of war prove derelict and
refuse to carry out proper orders of the captive power or its
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>
forces, such prisoners of war are subject to court-martial and
military proceedings as if they were serving under their own
forces. Here is a decree which, on its face, authorizes or attempts
to authorize guard personnel to use the rifle or other suitable means
of violence; and of course Your Lordship will understand it was
this type of document we had in mind when we suggested that
the decree of Bormann should be considered in the light of his
other orders relating to the treatment of prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>LT. LAMBERT: The Tribunal will recall that at the close of the
morning session I had been putting in a series of decrees of the
Defendant Bormann in which he called for increasingly harsh and
severe treatment of Allied prisoners of war. These instructions
issued by the Defendant Bormann culminated in his decree of
30 September 1944. The attention of the Tribunal is invited to
Document 058-PS, previously put in as Exhibit Number USA-456.
The Tribunal will recall that this decree of the Defendant Bormann
removed jurisdiction over all prisoners of war from the Nazi High
Command and transferred it to Himmler. The decree also provided
that all PW camp commanders should be under the orders of the
local SS commanders. By virtue of this order of the Defendant Bormann,
Hitler was enabled to proceed with his program of inhuman
treatment and even extermination of Allied prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now proceed to put in what the Prosecution conceive to be
extremely important and extremely incriminating evidence against
Bormann and the co-conspirators, that is, the responsibility of the
Defendant Bormann for the organized lynching of Allied airmen.
I offer in evidence Document 062-PS, Exhibit Number USA-696; and
I very respectfully request the Tribunal to turn to this document.
On its face it is an order dated 13 March 1940 from the Defendant
Hess addressed to Reichsleiter, Gauleiter, and other Nazi officials and
organizations. In this order these Party officials are instructed by
the Defendant Hess to instruct the German civil population to
arrest or liquidate all bailed-out Allied fliers. I call the attention
of the Tribunal to the third paragraph on the first page of the
English translation of Document 062-PS. In the third paragraph Hess
directs that these instructions, which I shall soon read, are to be
passed out only orally to all—will the Tribunal please mark that—district
leaders or Kreisleiter, Ortsgruppenleiter, cell leaders, and
even the block leaders; that is to say, this order must be passed out
by all the officials of the Leadership Corps to the Hoheitsträger,
ranging from Reichsleiter down to, and including, the Blockleiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now turn to Document 062-PS, and the Tribunal will find the
instructions which Hess demanded be disseminated by the Leadership
Corps orally: The lynching of Allied fliers. These directions are
headed: “About behavior in case of landings of enemy planes or
parachutists.” The first three instructions I omit as not material to
the basic point now being made. Instruction 4 reads, and I quote:
“Likewise enemy parachutists are immediately to be arrested or
liquidated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It speaks for itself and requires no further comment from the
Prosecution.
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, in order to insure the success of this scheme ordered by
the Defendant Hess, Bormann issued a secret letter, dated 30 May
1944, to the officials, if the Tribunal will please mark, of the Leadership
Corps of the Nazi Party, prohibiting any police measures or
criminal proceedings against German civilians who had lynched or
murdered Allied airmen. This document, our 057-PS, has been
previously put in and received by the Tribunal in connection with
the Prosecution’s case against the alleged criminal organization, the
Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, may it please the Tribunal, that such lynchings, organized,
authorized, and consented to by Defendant Bormann, actually took
place has since been fully and indisputably demonstrated by trials
by American military commissions which have resulted in the conviction
of German civilians for the murder of Allied fliers. I request
the Tribunal to take judicial notice of Military Commission Order
Number 2, Headquarters 15th U. S. Army, dated 23 June 1945. This
order is our Document 2559-PS. This order imposed the sentence
of death upon a German civilian for violation of the laws and usages
of war in murdering an American airman who had bailed out and
landed without any means of defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will note from that order of the American Military
Commission the 15th of August 1944 as date of crime; Bormann’s
order was dated May 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I request the Tribunal to notice judicially Military Commission
Order Number 5, Headquarters 3rd U. S. Army and Eastern Military
District, dated 18 October 1945. This order is set forth in Document
2560-PS. This order imposed a sentence of death upon a German
national for violating the laws and usages of war by murdering, on
or about 12 December 1944, an American airman who landed in
German territory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We could cite further orders of American and other Allied military
commissions sentencing German civilians to death for the lynching
and murdering of Allied airmen who had bailed out and landed
without means of defense on German territory. We think our point
is made by taking the time of the Tribunal to cite those two orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As previously mentioned in the trial address, on 20 October 1944,
when Nazi defeat in the war had become certain, Bormann assumed
political and organizational command of the newly-formed Volkssturm,
the people’s army. By virtue of ordering the continued
resistance by the Volkssturm, Bormann bears some responsibility
for the resistance which prolonged the aggressive war for months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I come now, if it please the Tribunal, to present the proofs
showing that Bormann authorized, directed, and participated in a
wide variety of Crimes against Humanity in aid of the conspiracy.
Bormann played an important role in the administration of the
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>
forced labor program. I offer in evidence Document D-226, Exhibit
Number USA-697. This is a Speer circular, a circular of the Defendant
Speer of 10 November 1944, transmitting Himmler’s instructions
that the Party and the Gestapo should co-operate in securing a
larger productivity from the millions of impressed foreign workers
in Germany. I quote the second numbered paragraph of Page 2 of
the English translation of Document D-226, which reads as follows.
I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“All men and women of the NSDAP, its subsidiaries and
affiliated bodies in the works”—meaning of course factories—“will,
in accordance with instructions from their Kreisleiter,
be warned by their local group leaders”—we intrude to say
that means Ortsgruppenleiter—“and be put under obligation
to play their part in keeping foreigners under the most careful
observation. They will report the least suspicion to the works
foreman, which he will pass on to the defense deputy or,
where such a deputy has not been appointed, to the police
department concerned, while at the same time reporting to
the works manager and the local group leader”—the Ortsgruppenleiter—“to
exert untiringly and continuously their
influence on foreigners, both in word and deed, in regard to
the certainty of German victory and the German will to resist,
thus producing a further increase of output in the works.</p>
<hr class='tbk406'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Party members, both men and women, and members of
Party organizations and affiliated bodies must be expected
more than ever before to conduct themselves in an exemplary
manner.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, in a word, the significance of that decree: It is true it is a
circular of Speer’s reciting an arrangement between himself and
Himmler, but the effect of the arrangement is to impose the onus
and the continuous task of supplying foreign workers on Party
members, a Party which, as the Tribunal knows, Bormann headed as
executive chief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the decree of 24 January 1942 no such directive could
have been issued without the participation of Bormann, both in its
preparation and its enactment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now offer in evidence Document 025-PS as Exhibit Number
USA-698. This is a conference report dated 4 September 1942 which
states that the recruitment, importation, mobilization, and processing
of 500,000 female domestic workers from the east would be handled
exclusively by the Defendant Sauckel, Himmler, and the Defendant
Bormann. I quote the first two sentences of the third paragraph
of the English translation of Document 025-PS, which reads as
follows:
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Führer has ordered the immediate importation of 400,000
to 500,000 female domestic eastern workers from the Ukraine
between the ages of 15 and 35 and has charged the Plenipotentiary
for Allocation of Labor with the execution of this
action which is to end in about 3 months. In connection with
this—this is also approved by Reichsleiter Bormann—the
illegal bringing of female housekeepers into the Reich by
members of the Armed Forces, or various other agencies is to
be allowed subsequently and, furthermore, irrespective of the
official recruiting, is not to be prevented.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And I now quote from the first sentence of the last paragraph
on Page 4 of the English translation of Document Number 025-PS,
and this is the part that hooks in the Defendant Bormann with the
scheme:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Generally one gathered from this conference that the
questions concerning the recruitment and mobilization, as well
as the treatment of female domestic workers from the east,
are being handled by the Plenipotentiary for Allocation of
Labor, the Reichsführer SS, and the Chief of the German
Police and the Party Chancellery, and that the Reich Ministry
for the Occupied Eastern Territories is in these questions
considered as having no, or only limited, competence.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Party Chancellery is here mentioned in terms, and Bormann
was the leader of the Party Chancellery, as the Tribunal
knows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the defendant imposed his will on the administration of
the German-occupied areas and insisted on the ruthless exploitation
of the inhabitants of the occupied East. The attention of the
Tribunal is respectfully invited to Document R-36, previously
put in as Exhibit Number USA-344. The Tribunal is well acquainted
with this document, for it has been referred to several times in these
proceedings, and knows that this is an official memorandum of the
Ministry for Occupied Eastern Territories, dated 19 August 1942,
which states that the repressive views of the Defendant Bormann
with respect to the inhabitants of the Eastern areas actually determined
German occupational policies in the East. The Tribunal
recalls the now almost notorious quotation from this Document R-36,
which purports to paraphrase and constitute the essence of Bormann’s
views with respect to German occupational policy in the
East. So often has it been quoted that I shall resist the temptation
to repeat it, but in essence it comes to this. Bormann in effect says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Slavs are to work for us. In so far as we don’t need
them, they may die. They should not receive the benefits of
the German public health system. We do not care about their
fertility. They may practice abortion and use contraceptives;
<span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span>
the more the better. We don’t want them educated; it is
enough if they can count up to 100. Such stooges will be the
more useful to us. Religion we leave to them as a diversion.
As to food, they will not get any more than is absolutely
necessary. We are the masters; we come first.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We respectfully submit this as an accurate paraphrase and summary
of the text of that document, Document R-36.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attention of the Tribunal is next respectfully invited to
Document 654-PS, previously put in as Exhibit Number USA-218.
The Tribunal will recall that this is a conference report, dated
18 November 1942, embodying an agreement between the Minister
of Justice and Himmler entered into by Bormann’s suggestion under
which all inhabitants of the Eastern occupied areas are subjected
to a brutal police regime in the place of an ordinary judicial
system. And the agreement refers all disputes between the Party,
Reich Minister for Justice, and Himmler to Bormann for settlement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, because Bormann issued these and related orders, we
submit that he bears a large share of the responsibility for the
discriminatory treatment and the extermination of great numbers
of persons in German-occupied areas of the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the indulgence of the Tribunal, I put the substance of
what I have been privileged to present in a few words. We have
shown that Bormann, only 45 years old at the time of Germany’s
defeat, contributed his entire adult life to the furtherance of the
conspiracy. His crucial contribution to the conspiracy lay in his
direction of the vast powers of the Nazi Party in advancing the
multiple objectives of the conspiracy. First, as Chief of Staff to the
Defendant Hess and then, as leader, in his own name, of the Party
Chancellery, subject only to Hitler’s supreme authority, he applied
and directed the total power of the Party and its agencies to carry
into execution the plans of the conspirators. He used his great
powers to persecute the Christian Church and clergy and was an
unrepentant foe of the fundamentals of the Christianity with which
he warred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He actively authorized and participated in measures designed to
persecute the Jews, and his was a strong hand in pressing down
the crown of thorns of misery on the brow of the Jewish people,
both in Germany and in German-occupied Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Chief of the Party Chancellery and secretary to the Führer,
Bormann authorized, directed, and participated in a wide variety
of War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, including, without
limitation, the lynching of Allied airmen, the enslavement and inhuman
treatment of the inhabitants of German-occupied Europe,
the cruelty of impressed labor, the breaking up of homes contrary
<span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span>
to the clear provisions of the Hague regulations, and the planned
persecution and extermination of the civil population of Eastern
Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May it please this Tribunal, every schoolboy knows that Hitler
was an evil man. The point we respectfully emphasize is that
without chieftains like Bormann, Hitler would never have been able
to seize and consolidate total power in Germany, but he would
have been left to walk the wilderness alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was, in truth, an evil archangel to the Lucifer of Hitler; and,
although he may remain a fugitive from the justice of this Tribunal,
with an empty chair in the dock, Bormann cannot escape
responsibility for his illegal conduct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And we close with what seems to us an extremely important
point. Bormann may not be here, but under the last sentence of
Article VI of the Charter every defendant in this dock shown in
our evidence to have been a leader, an organizer, an inciter, and
an accomplice of this conspiracy is responsible for the acts of all
persons in furtherance of the general scope of the conspiracy. And
resting squarely on this proposition we submit, even though Bormann
is not here, that every man in the dock shares responsibility
for his criminal acts. And with this we close. The name of Bormann
is not “written in water,” but will be remembered as long
as the Record of Your Honors’ Tribunal is preserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now have the privilege of introducing Lieutenant Henry Atherton,
who will present the case for the Prosecution against the
individual Defendant Seyss-Inquart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LIEUTENANT HENRY K. ATHERTON (Assistant Trial Counsel
for the United States): May it please the Tribunal, the Prosecution
has prepared a trial brief for the convenience of the Tribunal
showing the individual responsibility of the Defendant Seyss-Inquart.
Copies of this brief are now being handed to the Tribunal.
At the same time the document books which bear the letters “KK”
and which contain translations of the evidence referred to in the
brief, or to be introduced in evidence at this time, are also being
handed to the Tribunal. At the outset I wish to make clear my
intention to deal at this time only with the individual responsibility
of Seyss-Inquart for the crimes charged in Counts One and Two
of the Indictment. Evidence to show his guilt as charged under
Counts Three and Four of the Indictment, that is, evidence specifically
directed thereunto, is to be introduced later by the prosecutors
of the French Republic and the Soviet Union.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seyss-Inquart has agreed that he held the following positions
in State and Party, and I am referring now to Document 2910-PS,
which is Exhibit Number USA-17. He was State Councillor of
Austria from May 1937 to 12 February 1938. He was Minister of [the]
<span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>
Interior and Security of Austria from 16 February 1938 to 11 March
1938; Chancellor of Austria from 11 March to 15 March 1938; Reich
Governor of Austria from 15 March 1938 to 1 May 1939; Reich
Minister without Portfolio from 1 May 1939 until September of
that year; member of the Reich Cabinet from 1 May 1939 until
the end of the war; Chief of the Civil Administration of South
Poland from the early part of September 1939 until 12 October 1939;
Deputy Governor General of Poland under the Defendant Frank
from 12 October 1939 until May 1940; and, finally, Reich Commissioner
of the Occupied Territories of the Netherlands from
29 May 1940 until the end of the war. He has also agreed that he
became a member of the National Socialist Party on 13 March 1938
and that he was appointed a general in the SS 2 days later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now this list of positions which Seyss-Inquart has agreed that he
held, if the Tribunal please, shows the place which he held in the
Nazi Common Plan or Conspiracy. It shows his steady rise to
greater influence and power, and especially it emphasizes his particular
talent, his skill in effecting the enslavement of the smaller
nations surrounding Germany for the benefit of what he called
the Greater German Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the Defendant Seyss-Inquart first became a member of the
Nazi conspiracy in connection with the Nazi assault on Austria.
Mr. Alderman has shown how the Nazis implemented their diplomatic
and military preparations for this event by intensive political
preparations within Austria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ultimate purpose of these preparations was to secure the
appointment of Nazis, or persons known to be sympathetic to them,
to key positions in the Austrian Government, particularly that of
Minister of the Interior and Security, which controlled the police,
thus permitting quick suppression of all opposition to the Nazis
when the time came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this purpose Seyss-Inquart was a most effective tool, the
first of the so-called Quislings or traitors used by the Nazis to
further their aggressions and to fasten their hold on their victims.
Seyss-Inquart has admitted his membership in the Party only from
13 March 1938, but I want to show that he was closely affiliated
with them at a much earlier time. For this purpose I now offer
in evidence Document 3271-PS as Exhibit Number USA-700.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reading from Page 9 of the translation, he says in this letter,
which is a letter to Himmler, dated 19 August 1939:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As far as my membership in the Party is concerned, I state
that I was never asked to join the Party but had asked Dr.
Kier in December 1931 to clarify my relationship with the
Party, since I regarded the Party as the basis for the solution
of the Austrian problem .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I paid my membership fees and,
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>
as I believe, directly to the Gau Vienna. These contributions
also took place after the period of suppression. Later on I
had direct contact with the Ortsgruppe in Dornbach. My wife
paid these fees, but the Blockwart”—and I believe that is
another word for Blockleiter—“was never in doubt, considering
that this amount, 40 shillings per month, was a share for
my wife and myself, and I was in every respect treated as a
Party member.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Seyss-Inquart, in the last sentence of the paragraph says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In every way, therefore, I felt as a Party member, considered
myself a Party member, thus, as stated, as far back
as December 1931.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, if the Tribunal please, and before I leave this letter, I
want just to refer to one or two sentences which the Tribunal will
find in the third paragraph on Page 7 of the translation. Referring
to a meeting which he had had with Hitler, Seyss-Inquart says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I left this discussion a very upright man with the unspeakably
happy feeling of being permitted to be a tool of the
Führer.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The truth of the matter is that Seyss-Inquart was an active
supporter of the Nazis at all times after 1931. But after the Nazi
Party in Austria was declared illegal in July 1934, he avoided too
notorious a connection with the Nazi organization, in order to
safeguard what the Nazis called his good legal position. By this
device he was better able to use his connections with Catholics and
others in his work of infiltration for his Nazi superiors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will remember, as Document 2219-PS, Exhibit
Number USA-62, a letter from Seyss-Inquart to Göring of 14 July
1939, in which Seyss-Inquart makes this clear. It was in this letter
also that he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Yet, I know that I cling with unconquerable tenacity to the
goal in which I believe; that is Greater Germany and the
Führer.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence which Mr. Alderman introduced told in detail the
manner in which the Nazi conspirators carried out their assault on
Austria. I do not intend to attempt to review any part of this
evidence. I merely wish to refer the Tribunal to two documents
which are particularly important in showing the part played by
this defendant. I refer to the Rainer report to Gauleiter Bürckel,
dated 6 July 1939, which relates the part played by the Austrian
Nazi Party, the Defendant Seyss-Inquart and others between July
1934 and March 1938; and the astonishing record of telephone calls
between the Defendant Göring or his agents in Berlin and Seyss-Inquart
and others in Vienna on 11 March 1938. The Rainer report
is Document 812-PS, Exhibit Number USA-61, and was read into
<span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span>
the Record beginning at Page 502 (Volume II, Page 370) of the English
version and continuing for a number of pages thereafter. The
transcript of the telephone calls is Document 2949-PS, Exhibit
Number USA-76, and was introduced first at Page 566 (Volume II,
Page 414) of the English Record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, in order to supplement this and further to show that part
played by Seyss-Inquart, I wish now to introduce in evidence the
voluntary statement which Seyss-Inquart signed with advice of his
counsel on 10 December 1945. This is Document 3425-PS, and I
offer it as Exhibit Number USA-701.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this statement Seyss-Inquart explains, from his point of view,
his part in bringing about the Anschluss. I want to read first just
a few sentences from the second paragraph on the first page. It
states, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In 1918 I became interested in the Anschluss of Austria with
Germany. From that year on I worked, planned, and collaborated
with others of a like mind to bring about a union of
Austria with Germany. It was my desire to effect this union
of the two countries in an evolutionary manner, and by legal
means.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Skipping just a sentence or two:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I supported also the National Socialist Party as long as it
was legal, because it declared itself with particular determination
in favor of the Anschluss. From 1932 onwards I made
financial contributions to this Party, but I discontinued
financial support when it was declared illegal in 1934.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then skipping down another couple of sentences:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“From July 1936 onwards I endeavored to help the National
Socialists to regain their legal status and, finally, to participate
in the Austrian Government. During this time, particularly
after the Party was forbidden in July 1934, I knew that the
radical element of the Party was engaged in terroristic activities,
such as attacks on railroads, bridges, telephone communications,
et cetera. I knew that the governments of both
Chancellors, Dollfuss and Schuschnigg, although they held in
principle the same total German viewpoint were opposed to
the Anschluss then because of the National Socialist regime
in the Reich. I was sympathetic towards the efforts of the
Austrian Nazi Party to gain political power and corresponding
influence, because they were in favor of the Anschluss.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, briefly summarizing, the Tribunal will note that the
defendant tells how his appointment as State Councillor, in May
1937, was the result of an agreement between Austria and Germany
in July 1936, and that was the agreement which Rainer agreed
Seyss-Inquart had helped to bring about; that his appointment as
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span>
Minister of the Interior and Security was one of the results of the
agreement between Schuschnigg and Hitler at Berchtesgaden, 12
February 1938. And he admits that after the appointment and the
agreement the Austrian National Socialists engaged in more and
more widespread demonstrations. He tells how immediately after
this appointment as Minister of the Interior and Security he went
directly to Berlin and talked with Himmler and Hitler; and then,
finally, he describes the events of that day, of the 11th of March
1938, when with the full support of German military power he
became Chancellor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I don’t want to quote at length from that description, because
the Tribunal knows already what happened. Reading from the
middle of Page 3, he says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At 10 o’clock in the morning Glaise-Horstenau and I went to
the office of the Bundeskanzler and conferred for about 2
hours with Dr. Schuschnigg. We frankly told him all that we
knew, particularly about the possibility of disturbances and
of preparations by the Reich.</p>
<hr class='tbk407'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Chancellor said that he would give his decision by 1400
hours. While I was with Glaise-Horstenau and Dr. Schuschnigg,
I was repeatedly called to the telephone to speak to Göring.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Has this been read already?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. ATHERTON: No, Sir; this document has not been in before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>LT. ATHERTON: “He informed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. me that the agreement of
12 February had been cancelled and demanded Dr. Schuschnigg’s
resignation and my appointment as Chancellor.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal has heard the other side of that story, the actual
telephone conversations. And then, finally, the next two paragraphs,
he tells how Keppler repeatedly urged him to send a telegram
calling on Germany to send troops, and that at first he refused but
finally acquiesced, and I now read from the next to the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As I am able to gather from the records available, I was
requested about 10 p. m. to give my sanction to another somewhat
altered telegram about which I informed President Miklas
and Dr. Schuschnigg. Finally President Miklas appointed me
Chancellor, and a little while later he approved my list of
proposed ministers.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>If the Tribunal will recall, the telegram in question called on
Hitler, on behalf of the Provisional Austrian Government, to send
German troops as soon as possible in order to support it in its task
and help it to prevent bloodshed. The text of the telegram, as
<span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span>
printed in Volume 6 of the <span class='it'>Dokumente der Deutschen Politik</span>, appears
as Document 2463-PS of the document book. It is interesting to
note that the text of this telegram is substantially identical with
that dictated by Göring over the phone to Keppler on the evening
of the 11th of March, which appears on Page 575 (Volume II, Page
420) of the Record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, on the next morning, again referring to the statement of
the defendant, he admits that he telephoned Hitler.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Are you reading?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. ATHERTON: No, Sir; I am summarizing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): If you don’t read it it is not in
evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. ATHERTON: In that event I will read a little further.
I read now the last paragraph on Page 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the morning of the 12th of March I had a telephone
conversation with Hitler in which I suggested that, while
German troops were entering Austria, Austrian troops, as a
symbol, should march into the Reich. Hitler agreed to this
suggestion and we agreed to meet in Linz, Upper Austria,
later on that same day. I then flew to Linz with Himmler,
who had arrived in Vienna from Berlin. I greeted Hitler
on the balcony of the City Hall and said that Article 88 of
the Treaty of St. Germain was now inoperative.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I have referred to the slavish manner in which, as the evidence
has shown, Seyss-Inquart carried out orders conveyed to him by
telephone from Göring on 11 March 1938 in his negotiations with
Chancellor Schuschnigg and President Miklas. This relationship
had in fact existed for some time. Early in January 1938, Seyss-Inquart,
although he then held an important position in the Austrian
Government, had already considered himself as holding a mandate
from the Nazi conspirators in Berlin in his negotiations with his
own Government. As evidence of the way in which this happened,
I offer Document 3473-PS as Exhibit Number USA-581. This is a
letter from Keppler to Göring, dated 6 January 1938, in which he
states, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“My dear Colonel General:</p>
<hr class='tbk408'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Councillor of State, Dr. Seyss-Inquart, has sent a courier to
me with the report that his negotiations with the Federal
Chancellor, Dr. Schuschnigg, have run aground, so that he
feels compelled to return the mandate entrusted to him. Dr.
Seyss-Inquart desires to have a discussion with me regarding
this before he acts accordingly.</p>
<hr class='tbk409'/>
<p class='noindent'>“May I ask your advice, whether at this moment such a
step, entailing automatically also the resignation of the
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>
Federal Minister Glaise von Horstenau, appears indicated or
whether I should put forth efforts to postpone such an
action.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The letter is signed by Keppler. On top of the original is a
brief note apparently attached by the secretary of the Defendant
Göring and dated Karinhall, 6 January 1938, reading as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Keppler should be told by telephone:</p>
<hr class='tbk410'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1) He should do everything to avoid the resignation of
Councillor of State Dr. Seyss-Inquart and State Minister
Glaise von Horstenau. If some difficulties should arise,
Seyss-Inquart should come to him first of all.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now as a result of this directive, apparently telephoned to
Keppler, Keppler, on the 8th of January 1938, wrote a letter to
Seyss-Inquart. I now offer this letter, which is Document Number
3397-PS, in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-702. Keppler writes,
and the Tribunal will remember that Keppler was, at that time,
Secretary of State in charge of Austrian affairs of the German
Government:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Dear State Councillor:</p>
<hr class='tbk411'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The other day I had a visit from Mr. Pl. who gave us a
report of the state of affairs, and informed us that you are
seriously considering the question of whether or not you are
forced to hand back the mandate entrusted to you.</p>
<hr class='tbk412'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I informed General Göring of the situation in writing, and
G. just had me informed that I should try my utmost to
prevent you, or any one else, from taking this step. This
is also in the same vein as G.’s conversation with Dr. J.
before Christmas; at any rate, G. requests you to undertake
nothing of this nature under any circumstances before he
himself has the opportunity of speaking with you once more.</p>
<hr class='tbk413'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I can also inform you that G. is, furthermore, making an
effort to speak to Ll., in order that certain improper conditions
be eliminated by him.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then the letter is signed by Keppler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two letters together, if the Tribunal please, show clearly
enough the extent to which this defendant was a tool, the extent
to which he was being used at that time by the conspirators in
their planning for their assault on Austria. Now, once German
troops were in Austria and Seyss-Inquart had become Chancellor,
he lost no time carrying out the plan of his Nazi fellow conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I next offer in evidence Document 3254-PS, which is a memorandum
written by the Defendant Seyss-Inquart entitled, “The
Austrian Question.” It is Exhibit Number USA-704. I offer it only
<span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span>
because of the description which he gives of the manner in which
he secured the passage of an Austrian act in annexing Austria to
Germany. He said that on March 13 German officials brought him
a proposal for inviting Austria into Germany. They reported
that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you quoting?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. ATHERTON: I now quote from the middle of Page 20 of
the English text:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I called a meeting of the Council of Ministers, after having
been told by Dr. Wolf that the Bundespräsident would make
no difficulties in regard to that realization; he would return
to his home in the meantime and would await me there. On
my proposal the Council of Ministers assembled in the
meantime adopted the draft bill to which my law section had
made some formal modifications. The vote on the 20th of
April had been planned already in the first draft. According
to the provisions of the Constitution of 1 May 1934, any
fundamental modification of the Constitution could be
decided by the Council of Ministers with the approbation of
the Bundespräsident. A vote or a confirmation by the nation
was in no way provided for. In the event that the Bundespräsident
should, for any reason, either resign his functions
or be for some time unable to fulfill them, his prerogatives
were to go over to the Bundeskanzler. I went to the Bundespräsident
with Dr. Wolf. The President told me that he did
not know whether this development would be of benefit to
the Austrian nation but that he did not wish to interfere
and preferred to resign his functions, so that all constitutional
rights would come into my hands.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then, skipping two or three sentences to the top of Page 21:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Thereafter I returned to Linz by car, where I arrived about
midnight and reported to the Führer the accomplishment of
the Anschluss law.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The same day Germany formally incorporated Austria into the
Reich by a decree and declared it to be a province of the German
Reich, in violation of Article 80 of the Treaty of Versailles. I ask
the Court to take judicial notice of Document Number 2307-PS,
which is the decree to this effect, published in 1938 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, Page 237.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Defendant Seyss-Inquart seems unduly modest as to the
part which he played in undermining the Government to which he
owed allegiance, his fellow conspirators were quick to recognize the
importance of his contributions. In a speech on the 26th of March
1938, the Defendant Göring said—and I am reading now from
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>
Document 3270-PS, Exhibit Number USA-703, which is an extract
from the <span class='it'>Dokumente der Deutschen Politik</span>, Volume 6, Page 183:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“A complete unanimity between the Führer and the National
Socialist confidants inside of Austria existed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If the
National Socialists’ rising succeeded so quickly and thoroughly
and without bloodshed, it is first of all due to the
calm, firm, prudent, and decisive attitude of the present
Reichsstatthalter Seyss-Inquart and his confidants.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I want, before leaving the matter of the Anschluss, to stress
this once more, because this was a time of great importance, and
it was Seyss-Inquart who held the key position in this first open
attack on another country. Had it not been for his part, as has
been shown, things might have gone very differently, and if there
were no other place where he was connected with the conspirators’
plans for aggression, this would be sufficient to rank him with the
foremost of the conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, passing on, Mr. Alderman has shown the way in which
Seyss-Inquart co-operated with the conspirators in integrating
Austria as fully as possible into the Reich, making its resources
available to the Reich—its resources of wealth and its resources
of manpower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In furtherance of the conspirators’ plan, Reichsstatthalter Seyss-Inquart
for the first time demonstrated his talent for the persecution
of Jewish citizens. In an address in Vienna on the 26th of
March 1938, which will be found at Page 2326 (Volume IV, Page 552)
of the Record, he recalls that Göring expressly commissioned this
defendant, as Reichsstatthalter, to institute anti-Semitic measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Tribunal will remember from previous evidence the
kind of wholesale larceny which this involved. So successfully did
Seyss-Inquart perform his task that at the meeting of the Air
Ministry under the chairmanship of the Defendant Göring on the
12th of November 1938, Fischböck, a member of Seyss-Inquart’s
official family, was able to relate the efficiency with which the
civil administration in Austria dealt with the so-called “Jewish
question.” I refer to Document Number 1816-PS, Exhibit Number
USA-261, and I am reading first from Page 14 of the English
translation. The Tribunal will note that this is the third full
paragraph from the bottom of Page 14:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Your Excellency: In this matter we have already a very
complete plan for Austria. There are 12,000 Jewish artisans
and 5,000 Jewish retail shops in Vienna. Before the seizure
of power we had already a definite plan for tradesmen,
regarding this total of 17,000 stores. Of the shops of the
12,000 artisans about 10,000 were to be closed definitely and
2,000 were to be kept open; 4,000 of the 5,000 retail stores
<span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span>
should be closed and 1,000 should be kept open, that is,
Aryanized. According to this plan, between 3,000 and 3,500
of the total of 17,000 stores would be kept open, all others
closed. This was decided following investigations in every
single branch and according to local needs, in agreement with
all competent authorities, and is ready for publication as
soon as we receive the law which we requested in September.
This law shall empower us to withdraw licenses from artisans
quite independent of the Jewish question.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Göring said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I shall have this decree issued today.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then, if the Tribunal please, I just wish to read one more
sentence from the middle of the next page, in which Fischböck says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Out of 17,000 stores 12,000 or 14,000 would be closed and
the remainder Aryanized or handed over to the Bureau of
Trustees which is operated by the State.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And Göring replies:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have to say that this proposal is grand. This way the
whole affair would be wound up in Vienna, one of the
Jewish capitals, so to speak, by Christmas or by the end of
the year.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Funk then says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We can do the same thing over here.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In other words, Seyss-Inquart’s so-called solution was so highly
regarded that it was considered a model for the rest of the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The task of integrating Austria into the Reich being substantially
complete, the Nazi conspirators were able to use Seyss-Inquart’s
expert services for the subjugation of other peoples. As an illustration
I refer the Tribunal to Document D-571, Exhibit Number
USA-112, which has already been read in evidence. The Tribunal
will recall that from this document it appeared that on the 21st
of March 1939 an official of the British Government reported from
Prague to Viscount Halifax that a little earlier, on the 11th of
March 1939, Seyss-Inquart, Bürckel, and five German generals
attended a meeting of the Cabinet of the Slovak Government and
told them that they should proclaim the independence of Slovakia,
that Hitler had decided to settle the question of Czechoslovakia
definitely (this has been read in court today) and that, unless they
did as they were told, Hitler would disinterest himself in their fate.
It just gives an indication of the manner in which this man continued
to be busy in the aggressive plans of these Nazi conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now early in September 1939, after the opening of the attack
against Poland, Seyss-Inquart became Chief of the Civil Administration
of south Poland. A few weeks later, on 12 October 1939,
<span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span>
Hitler promulgated a decree providing that territories occupied by
German troops, except those incorporated within the German
Reich, should be subject to the authority of the Governor General
of the occupied Polish territories and he appointed the Defendant
Frank as Governor General and the Defendant Seyss-Inquart as
Deputy Governor General. This decree will be found in the 1939
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, Page 2077, and I ask the Tribunal to take
judicial notice of it. Shortly thereafter, on 26 October 1939, Frank
promulgated a decree establishing the administration of the
occupied Polish territories, of which he was Governor. This decree
is published in the <span class='it'>Dokumente der Deutschen Politik</span> and appears
in the document book as 3468-PS. I am informed that this book,
Volume 7, has also received the Exhibit Number 705 and I offer
it as such.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Article 3 of the decree provided that the Chief of the Office of
the Governor General and the Higher SS and Police Leader are
directly subordinate to the Governor General and his Deputy. The
Deputy, of course, was the Defendant Seyss-Inquart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The significance of that provision is obvious in the light of the
evidence which the Tribunal has heard and will hear. I ask the
Tribunal to take judicial notice of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Deputy Governor General of the Polish occupied territories,
Seyss-Inquart seems to have had the job of setting up a German
administration throughout this territory; that is, he worked under
the Defendant Frank but did much of the work of interviewing
the various local leaders, telling them what they should do. As
an illustration I offer in evidence a report of a trip which Seyss-Inquart
and his consultants took between the 17th and 22d of
February 1939. This is our Document Number 2278-PS, and I offer
it as Exhibit Number USA-706. If the Tribunal please, I have
misstated that date or period. It was the 17th to the 22d of
November 1939, in other words, shortly after the administration
was set up. On the first page of the English translation—and I
now quote from the second full paragraph—the following appears:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At 3:00 p. m. Reich Minister, Dr. Seyss-Inquart, addressed
the department heads of the district chief and stated among
other things that the chief guiding rule for carrying out
German administration in the Government General must be
solely the interests of the German Reich. A stern and
inflexible administration must make the area of use to German
economy; and, so that excessive clemency may be
guarded against, the results of the intrusion of the Polish
race into German territory must be brought to mind.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This report is too long, if the Tribunal please, to quote from
at too great length; but if the Tribunal will turn over to Page 7,
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>
I would like to read in some extracts of what occurred while the
defendant was in Lublin. From the report it appears that the
Defendant Seyss-Inquart after meeting the various local German
administrative officers “then expounded the principles,” and I am
now quoting from the top of Page 7, “in accordance with which
the administration in the ‘Government’ must be conducted.” Then,
skipping a sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The resources and inhabitants of this country would have
to be made of service to the Reich, and only within these
limits could they prosper. Independent political thought
should no longer be allowed to develop. The Vistula area
might perhaps be still more important to German destiny
than the Rhine. The Minister then gave as a guiding theme
to the district leaders: ‘We will further everything which
is of service to the Reich and will put an end to everything
which may harm the Reich.’ Dr. Seyss-Inquart then added
that the Governor General wished that those men who were
fulfilling a task for the Reich here should receive a post with
material benefits in keeping with their responsibility and
achievements.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then, if the Tribunal will turn over two more pages, the
reporter is describing a sightseeing tour which was made to the
village of Wlodawa, Cycow, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Cycow is a German village.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”—skipping down a couple of
sentences—“Reich Minister Dr. Seyss-Inquart made a speech
in which he pointed out that the fidelity of these Germans
to their nationality now found its justification and reward
through the strength of Adolf Hitler.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then the next sentence, apparently thrown in by the
reporter:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This district with its very marshy character could, according
to District Chief Schmidt’s deliberations, serve as a reservation
for the Jews, a measure which might possibly lead
to heavy mortality among the Jews.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We might break off here for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>LT. ATHERTON: If the Tribunal please, at the time the Tribunal
rose, I was in the process of considering the functions of the
Defendant Seyss-Inquart, his place as Deputy Governor General
of Poland, between 1939 and 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the Tribunal has already heard evidence of the atrocities
which were perpetrated by the administration which Seyss-Inquart
thus helped to create. The prosecutors for the Soviet Union will
<span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span>
present to the Tribunal more evidence of such atrocities. For our
present purposes, to show the importance of the work which this
man did to further the Nazi plan for the Government General of
Poland, it is enough to quote a few words from the diary of the
Defendant Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the occasion of what was apparently a farewell lunch to
Seyss-Inquart, when he became Reich Commissioner of the Netherlands,
Frank said—and I now quote from Document 3465-PS,
Pages 510 and 511 of Volume 2, the 1940 volume of the diary,
which is Exhibit Number USA-614:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I am extremely glad, Mr. Reich Commissioner and Reich
Minister, to assure you, in this hour of your departure, that
the months of our collaboration with you belong to the most
precious memories of my life and that your work in the
Government General will be remembered forever in the
building of the coming world empire of the German nation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Skipping down a little, if the Tribunal please, Frank went on
to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the construction of the Government General your name
will forever take a place of honor as an originator of this
organization and this state system.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I express our thanks,
Mr. Reich Minister, for your collaboration and for your
creative energy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then reading the last two or three sentences:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the hard times common work united us here in the
East, but it is at the same time the beginning point for a
gigantic power development of the German Reich. Its
perfection will show the development of the greatest energy
unit which there ever was in the history of the world. In
this work you were placed by the Führer, very effectively,
in the most important position.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And to these remarks the Defendant Seyss-Inquart replied and
I now quote from the second page of the translation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I learned here a lot, many things which I did not understand
before at all, and mainly on account of the initiative and
firm leadership as I saw them in my friend Dr. Frank.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then, skipping a sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I will now go to the West, and I want to be quite open
with you. With my whole heart I am present, because my
whole attitude is one directed toward the East. In the East
we have a National Socialist mission; over there, in the West,
we have a function; that may be the difference.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I submit, if the Tribunal please, that the sentences which I
have just read show clearly enough the conscious participation of
the Defendant Seyss-Inquart in the Polish phase of the conspiracy.
<span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus equipped with experience gained in Poland under the
Defendant Frank, Seyss-Inquart was ready to undertake his last
and most ambitious task, the enslavement of the Netherlands. The
ruthless manner in which he performed it marks his position in the
Nazi Common Plan or Conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I ask the Tribunal first to take judicial notice of a decree of
Hitler of 18 May 1940, which is found in 1940 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, Page 778. The translation will be found in the book as
Document 1376-PS. By Section 1 of this decree it is provided that:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Commissioner is protector of the interests of the
Reich and will represent the supreme power of the Government
within the civil sphere. He will be directly subordinated
to me and will receive directives and orders from me.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Section 3 provides that:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Commissioner may use German Police forces to
carry out his orders. The German Police forces are at the
disposal of the German military commander in the Netherlands
insofar as military necessities require this and if the
missions of the Reich Commissioner permit it.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then by Paragraph or Section 5 of the law it is provided that
the Reich Commissioner may promulgate laws by decree, such orders
to be published in the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> for the occupied territory
of the Netherlands, a publication which I shall hereafter refer to
merely as the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 29th of May 1940, acting within these powers, the
defendant promulgated an order covering the exercise of governmental
authority in the Netherlands and this appears as Document
3588-PS in the document book. I ask the Tribunal to take judicial
notice of its contents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That will contain two decrees. I am now referring to the
first one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By Section 1 of this decree the defendant modestly purports to
assume, to the extent required for the fulfillment of his duties, “all
powers, privileges, and rights heretofore vested in the King and
the Government, in accordance with the constitution and the laws
of the Netherlands.” That is a direct quotation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Section 5 of the order entrusts the maintenance of
public peace, safety, and order to the Netherlands Police force
unless the Reich Commissioner calls on German SS or Police forces
for the enforcement of his orders. It further provides that the
investigation and combatting of all activities hostile to the Reich
and Germanism shall be the concern of the German Police force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On June 3, 1940, a further decree was promulgated concerning
the organization and establishment of the Office of the Reich Commissioner.
This decree is found in the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> for 1940,
<span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span>
Issue 1, at Page 11, and is the second decree under Document
3588-PS. This decree provided for general commissioners on the
staff of the Reich Commissioner to head four enumerated sections,
one of which, the Superior SS and Police Chief, was to head the
section for public safety. It was provided by Section 5 of this
decree that:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This official should command the units of the military SS
and German Police forces transferred to the occupied Netherlands
territories, supervise the Netherlands central and
municipal police forces and issue to them necessary orders.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Section 11 provided that the Reich Commissioner alone.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Lieutenant Atherton, don’t you think that
we can assume that the Defendant Seyss-Inquart, who had been
appointed to administer the occupied territory of the Netherlands,
had all these powers and that you can turn your attention to what
he did under those powers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. ATHERTON: Yes, Sir; I will do that but I wanted to make
plain to the Tribunal, because of the peculiar set-up of this German
Police force, the fact that he was granted the power to give orders
to them, and not only that, but that he customarily did. If that
point is made clear, as I believe it is, in these two decrees, I will
pass on to the next matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think the Tribunal has no doubt that an
officer under the Reich who had got the powers of the administrator
of an occupied territory could make use of the police forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. ATHERTON: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is really a matter that we should be
prepared to assume until it is proved to the contrary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. ATHERTON: I agree, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We would wish you to turn attention to
show what he did, under those powers, which constitute crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. ATHERTON: Yes, Sir. It is not our intention at this time
to go into the crimes against persons and property which the
Defendant Seyss-Inquart is responsible for in the Netherlands in
any detail, because evidence of Nazi barbarity in this country is
to be presented by our associates, the prosecutors for the French
Republic. It is only our purpose to show a few illustrations and
to give some idea of the scope of this defendant’s activities and his
responsibilities as evidence of his part in the execution of the Nazis’
Common Plan or Conspiracy, which it is our part to prove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, in the first place, there will be much evidence to show
that the defendant was responsible for widespread spoliation of
property. Merely as an illustration of the way in which he was
<span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span>
implicated in the smallest parts of this, I offer in evidence Document
176-PS, as Exhibit Number USA-707.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document is a report on the activities of the “Task Force
Netherlands,” a part of the Einsatzstab Rosenberg, on which the
Tribunal has already heard evidence. Quoting from the first page
of this report, the first sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Task Force Netherlands of the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter
Rosenberg began its work in agreement with the competent
representative of the Reich Commissioner during the first
days of September 1940.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The report then proceeds to detail the property taken from
Masonic lodges and similar institutions to a considerable extent.
Reading from—I believe it is Page 3 of this report, the very
bottom:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“An extremely precious library, containing invaluable works
on Sanskrit, was confiscated, when the ‘Theosophic Society’
in Amsterdam was dissolved, and packed into 96 cases.</p>
<hr class='tbk414'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A number of smaller libraries belonging to the Spiritists,
the Esperanto movement, the Bellamy movement, the International
Bible Students, and various other minor international
organizations were packed into seven cases; texts belonging
to various minor Jewish organizations were packed into four
cases; and a library of the ‘Anthroposophic Society’ in
Amsterdam into three.</p>
<hr class='tbk415'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It is safe to say that the stocks of books confiscated, packed,
and so far sent to Germany by the task force are of extraordinary
scientific value and will contribute an integral part
of the library of the ‘Hohe Schule.’</p>
<hr class='tbk416'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The money value of these libraries .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can only be estimated
but must surely amount to from 30 million to 40 million
Reichsmark.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then, quoting from the very end of the report:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The task force, in executing the aforementioned tasks, is
bound strictly to the pace set by the Reich Commissioner for
the handling of the Jewish questions and those of the international
organizations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As Reich Commissioner it was one of the functions of the
Defendant Seyss-Inquart to supervise the execution of the conspirators’
program for deportation of Dutch citizens to Germany
for slave-labor. The Tribunal will recall that Mr. Dodd read into
evidence at Page 1372 (Volume III, Page 477) a portion of a
transcript of an interrogation of the Defendant Sauckel, on
5 October 1945, in which it appeared that the quotas for the
workers for Holland were agreed upon and then the numbers
<span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span>
given to the Reich Commissioner Seyss-Inquart to fulfill; and after
the quota was given to Seyss-Inquart, it was his mission to fulfill
it with the aid of Sauckel’s representative. And then the Tribunal
will recall that at Page 1310 (Volume III, Page 433) of the Record
Mr. Dodd, having shown the Defendant Seyss-Inquart’s part in
recruitment for slave-labor in this fashion and his responsibility
for it, read into the Record, Page 1310 (Volume III, Page 433), some
portions from Document 1726-PS, Exhibit Number USA-195, which
showed the numbers of Netherlands citizens deported to the Reich
at various times. Since that is all a matter of record, I will not
go into it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Netherlands, as in Austria and elsewhere, Seyss-Inquart
was relentless in his treatment of Jewish Netherlanders. To
illustrate his attitude, I offer in evidence Document 3430-PS, which
consists of extracts from the defendant’s book <span class='it'>Four Years in the
Netherlands</span> (Collected Speeches). It becomes Exhibit Number
USA-708. In a speech in Amsterdam on 13 March 1941—and I am
now quoting from Page 57 of the original book, the last extract on
the translation, Seyss-Inquart said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Jews, for us, are not Dutch. They are those enemies
with whom we can come to neither an armistice nor to
peace. This applies here, if you wish, for the duration of the
occupation. Do not expect an order from me which stipulates
this, except regulations concerning police matters. We will
beat the Jews wherever we meet them, and those who join
them must bear the consequences. The Führer declared that
the Jews have played their final act in Europe, and therefore
they have played their final act.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, as promised, the Defendant Seyss-Inquart proceeded to
promulgate the long series of decrees which first threatened to
deprive the Jewish people in the Netherlands of their property,
of their rights, and degraded them to something lower than the
lowest, which eventually resulted in their deportation to Poland.
These decrees, all signed by Seyss-Inquart, are collected in our
brief, Page 65. I ask the Court to take judicial notice of them. By
way of illustration, the first to which I wish to refer appears in the
document book as 3333-PS, and it is a decree of 26 October 1940,
requiring the registration of businesses belonging to Jews as
defined in the decree, including partnerships or corporations in
which Jews owned a substantial interest. You have seen that this
type of law was the inevitable prelude to mass confiscation of the
property of Jews under the Nazi administration. In a law found
in <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span>, Volume Number 6, Page 99, 11 February 1941,
Document 3325-PS, Dutch universities and colleges were limited in
the registration of Jewish students. This of itself does not seem
<span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span>
important, but it is a part of the program to take away from these
people their rights and degrade them. Document Number 3328-PS
is a decree published in <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> Number 44 at Page 841,
of 22 October 1941. This prevented the Jews from exercising any
profession or trade without authorization from administrative
authorities and permitted such authorities to order the termination
of any employment contract concerning Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a final illustration I refer in passing to Document 3336-PS,
a decree published in the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span>, Issue 13, Page 289,
and dated 21 May 1942. This decree required all Jews to make
written declaration of claims of any kind, under which they might
be beneficiaries, at a banking firm known as Lippmann-Rosenthal
and Company, which was actually an agency of the Reich at
Amsterdam. The decree gave the bank, this named bank, all
rights to dispose of the claim and provided that payment to the
bank should be released in full. This type of Nazi decree was, of
course, a forerunner of ultimate deportation to the East and
allowed the Nazis to snatch the insurance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evidence of the success of this defendant’s efforts to annihilate
all Jews in the Netherlands has already been read into the Record.
The court will find that Major Walsh—again reading from the report
of the Netherlands Government, Exhibit Number USA-195, at Page
1497 (Volume III, Page 565)—showed that out of 140,000 Jewish
Netherlanders, 117,000 were deported, over 115,000 of them to
Poland, over 80 percent. The evidence has shown what was the
probable fate of most of these people, and I shan’t dwell on it
further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, I want to say a few words about the responsibility
of this defendant for the systematic terror practiced against the
inhabitants of the occupied territory by the Nazis throughout the
occupation. Referring again to the collected speeches in Document
3430-PS, on 29 January 1943, the defendant left little doubt of his
point of view. He said, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is also clear, now more than ever, that every resistance
which is directed against this fight for existence must be
suppressed. Some time ago the representatives of the churches
had written to the Wehrmacht commander and to me, and
they presented their ideas in regard to the execution of
death sentences which the Wehrmacht commander announced
in the meantime. To this I can say only the following: At
the moment in which our men, fathers, and sons with iron
determination look towards their fate in the East and unflinchingly
and steadfastly perform their highest pledge, it is
unbearable to tolerate conspiracies whose goal is to weaken
the rear of this eastern front. Whoever dares this must be
<span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span>
annihilated. We must be severe and become even more severe
against our opponents. This is the command of a relentless
sequence of events and for us, perhaps, inhumanly hard but
our holy duty. We remain human because we do not torture
our opponents. We must remain hard in annihilating them.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I do not offer any evidence of the commission of these crimes,
because that is to be done by prosecutors of the French Republic.
But the position of the Defendant Seyss-Inquart as Reich Commissioner,
the control which he exercised, which has been shown,
particularly over the SS and Police, and the attitude of the man
himself will make clear his authorization and participation in the
crimes to be proved and are a further indication of his part in
the common plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seyss-Inquart supported the Nazi Party as early as 1931. He
was a traitor to the government to which he owed allegiance
and in which he held high office. With full knowledge of the
ultimate purposes of the conspirators he bent every effort to integrate
Austria into the Reich and to make its resources and
manpower, as well as its strategic position, available for the
Nazi war machine. He performed these tasks with such ruthless
efficiency that he was chosen thereafter for key positions in the
enslavement of Poland and the Netherlands—the positions which
he filled with such satisfaction to his superiors, that ultimately he
came to be one of the foremost and most detested leaders in this
common plan. As such, under Article 6 of the Charter, he is responsible
for all acts performed by any persons in the execution of
that plan. As such, he is guilty of the crimes charged to him under
Counts One and Two of the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish to introduce to the Tribunal at this time Dr. Robert
M. W. Kempner, who will represent the Prosecution in the next
phase of the case dealing with the Defendant Frick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. ROBERT M. W. KEMPNER (Assistant Trial Counsel for
the United States): May it please the Tribunal: There have been
distributed to the Tribunal and to all Defense Counsel, trial brief
and documents relating to the Defendant Frick. The trial brief
prepared by my colleague, Karl Lachmann, sets forth, in great
detail, evidence, in the form of both documents and decrees, against
the Defendant Wilhelm Frick. English translations of the evidentiary
material referred to in the trial brief are included in the
document book prepared by my colleague Lieutenant Felton. This
book has been marked “LL.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Defendant Frick’s great contribution to the Nazi conspiracy
was in the field of governmental administration. He was the administrative
brain who devised the machinery of state for Nazism,
who geared that machinery for aggressive war.
<span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of his active participation in the Nazi conspiracy,
from 1923 to 1945, the Defendant Frick occupied a number of
important positions. Document 2978-PS, which has previously been
introduced as Exhibit Number USA-8, lists the positions in detail.
The original was signed by the Defendant Frick on 14 November
1945. I do not repeat these positions; they are known to the Court.
Frick’s past activity on behalf of the Nazi conspirators was his
participation in promoting their rise to power. Frick betrayed, in
his capacity as law enforcement official of the Bavarian Government,
his own Bavarian Government by participating in the Munich
Beer Hall Putsch of November 8, 1923. Frick was tried and
sentenced together with Hitler on a charge of complicity in treason.
His position in the Putsch is described in a record of the proceeding
called <span class='it'>The Hitler Trial before the People’s Court in Munich</span>,
published in Munich in 1924.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will ask this Tribunal to take judicial notice of this record
of these proceedings. Hitler’s appreciation of Frick’s assistance is
evidenced by the fact that he honored Frick by mentioning his
name in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>. Only two other Defendants in this proceeding
share this honor, namely, Hess and Streicher. I ask the Tribunal
to take judicial notice of the favorable mentioning of Defendant
Frick in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, German edition, 1933, Page 403.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the period after the Putsch, Frick made further contributions
to the Nazi conspiracy. I should like to refer briefly
to Document 2513-PS, an excerpt of Pages 36 and 38 from a report
entitled, “The National Socialist Workers Party as an Association
Hostile to the State and to the Republican Form of Government
and Guilty of Treasonable Activity.” This report has been previously
introduced as Document 2513-PS, Exhibit Number USA-235.
It is an official report of the criminal activities of Hitler, Frick,
and other Nazis prepared by the Prussian Ministry of the Interior
in 1930. It states that Frick, next to Hitler, can be regarded as
the most influential representative of the Nazi Party at that time.
This document reported that at the 1927 Party Congress in Nuremberg
Frick said that the Reichstag would first be misused by the
Nazi Party, would then be abolished, and that its abolition would
open the way for racial dictatorship. The document also reported
that Frick stated in a speech in 1929 at Pyritz that this fateful
struggle will first be taken up with the ballot, but this cannot
continue indefinitely, for history has taught us that in battle blood
must be shed and iron broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back in 1927 Frick’s prominent role in helping to bring the
Nazis to power was recognized when, on 23 January 1930, he was
appointed Minister of the Interior and Education in the State of
Thuringia.
<span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you passing from that document now?
I thought you were reading from 2513.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KEMPNER: No, this is an introduction of the next document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I see, Dr. Kempner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KEMPNER: I just started to refer to the fact that Adolf
Hitler at this time, when Frick was Minister of the Interior in the
State of Thuringia, was an undesirable alien, not a German citizen.
In his capacity as Minister of Thuringia the Defendant Frick began
his manipulations to provide Adolf Hitler, the undesirable alien,
with German citizenship, an essential step toward the realization of
the Nazi conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This lack of German citizenship was highly detrimental to the
cause of the Nazi Party because, as an alien, Hitler could not
become candidate for the Reich Presidency in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the Defendant Frick who solved this problem by an
administrative maneuver. We now introduce in evidence Document
3564-PS, Exhibit Number USA-709. This document is an
affidavit by Otto Meissner of 27 December 1945. Meissner was
former state secretary and chief of Hitler’s Presidential Chancellery.
The last two sentences of this affidavit read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Frick also, in collaboration with Klagges, Minister of
Brunswick, succeeded in naturalizing Hitler as a German
citizen in 1932 by having him appointed a Brunswick government
official Regierungsrat. This was done in order to
make it possible for Hitler to run as a candidate for the
office of President in the Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>When Hitler came to power on 30 January 1933, Frick was duly
awarded a prominent post in the new regime as Reich Minister of
the Interior. In this capacity he became responsible for the establishment
of totalitarian control over Germany, an indispensable
prerequisite for the preparation of aggressive warfare. Frick assumed
responsibility for the realization of a large part of the Nazi Conspirators’
program both through administration and legislation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must explain very briefly the significance of the Ministry of
the Interior in the Nazi State to show the contribution made by
Frick to the conspiracy. I offer, as evidence of Frick’s extensive
jurisdiction as Minister of the Interior, Document 3475-PS, Exhibit
Number USA-710, which is part of the official German manual for
administrative officials, dated 1943. I ask the Tribunal to take
judicial notice of Frick’s jurisdiction mentioned in this document.
The names of the men who, according to this document, worked
under Frick’s supervision, and I stress this point “worked under
Frick’s supervision,” are symbolic. They are listed on Page 1 of
the English translation. Here we find among the subordinates of
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>
Frick: Reich Health Leader, Dr. Conti; Reichsführer SS and Chief
of the German Police, Heinrich Himmler; and Reich Labor Service
leader, Hierl. This document shows Frick as supreme commander
of three important pillars of the Nazi State: the Nazi health service,
the Nazi police system, and the Nazi labor service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wide variety of Frick’s activities as Reich Minister of the
Interior can be judged from the following catalogue of his functions,
enumerated on the following pages of the manual. He had final
authority over constitutional questions, drafted legislation, had
jurisdiction over governmental administration and civil defense,
and was final arbiter in all questions concerning race and citizenship.
The manual also lists sections of the Ministry concerned
with administrative problems for the occupied territories and
annexed territories, the “New Order” in the Southeast, the Protectorate
of Bohemia and Moravia, and the “New Order” in the
East. He also had full jurisdiction in the field of civil service,
including such matters as appointment, tenure, promotion, and
dismissal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Frick used his wide powers as Reich Minister
of the Interior to advance the cause of the Nazi conspiracy. To
accomplish this purpose, he drafted and signed the laws and
decrees which abolished the autonomous state governments, the
autonomous local governments, and the political parties in Germany
other than the Nazi Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1933 and 1934, the first 2 years of the Nazi regime, Frick
signed about 235 laws or decrees, all of which are published in
the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>. I should like to refer briefly to a few of
the more important laws and decrees, such as the law of 14 July
1933 outlawing all political parties other than the Nazi Party,
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1933, Part I, Page 479, Document 1388(a)-PS;
then the law of 1 December 1933 securing the unity of Party and
State, <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1933, Part I, Page 1016, Document 1395-PS;
the law of 30 January 1934 transferring the sovereignty of the
German states to the Reich, <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1934, Part I, Page 75,
Document 3068-PS; the German Municipality Act of 30 January
1935, which gave Frick’s Ministry of the Interior final authority
to appoint and dismiss all mayors of municipalities throughout Germany,
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1935, Part I, Page 49, Document 2008-PS;
and, finally, the Nazi Civil Service Act of 7 April 1933 which
provided that all civil servants must be trustworthy as defined by
Nazi standards and also must meet the Nazi racial requirements,
published in <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1933, Part I, Page 175, Document
1397-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One category of Frick’s activities, however, deserves special
notice; that is, the crushing of opposition by legally camouflaged
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span>
police terror. This is shown by the book <span class='it'>Dr. Wilhelm Frick and
His Ministry</span>, our Document 3119-PS, which is in evidence as Exhibit
Number USA-711, written by Frick’s undersecretary and co-conspirator,
Hans Pfundtner, apparently written to establish Frick’s
eternal contribution to the creation of the Nazis’ thousand-year
Reich. It states, and I quote briefly from Page 4, paragraph 4, of
the English translation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“While Marxism in Prussia was crushed by the hard fist of
the Prussian Prime Minister Hermann Göring and a gigantic
wave of propaganda was initiated for the Reichstag elections
of 5 March 1933, Dr. Frick prepared the complete seizure
of power in all states of the Reich. All at once the political
opposition disappeared. All at once the Main”—River—“line
was eliminated; from this time on only one will and one
leadership reigned in the German Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>How was this done? On February 28, 1933, the day after the
Reichstag fire, civil rights in Germany were abolished. This decree
was published in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1933, Page 83; and an
English translation of it appears in the document book as 1390-PS.
I refer to this decree at this time because it carries the signature
of the Reich Minister of the Interior Frick. And now something
important. It is stated at the beginning of the decree, which was
published on the morning after the Reichstag fire, that the suspension
of civil rights is decreed as a defense measure against
Communist acts of violence endangering the State. At the time
of publication of this decree, the Nazi Government announced that
a thorough investigation had proven that the Communists had set
fire to the Reichstag building. I do not intend to go into the
controversial issue of who set fire to the Reichstag, but I should
like to offer proof that the official Nazi statement that the Communists
were responsible for the fire was issued without any
investigation and that the preamble of the decree which had Frick’s
signature was a mere subterfuge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I offer in evidence a very short excerpt of an interrogation of
Defendant Göring, dated October 13, 1945, our Document 3593-PS,
Exhibit Number USA-712, and I should like to read the following
brief portion, beginning on Page 4:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“My question to Göring: ‘How could you tell your press
agent, 1 hour after the Reichstag caught fire, that the Communists
did it, without investigation?’</p>
<hr class='tbk417'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Göring’s answer: ‘Did the public relations officer say that
at that time?’</p>
<hr class='tbk418'/>
<p class='noindent'>“My answer: ‘Yes. He said you said it.’</p>
<hr class='tbk419'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Göring: ‘It is possible when I came to the Reichstag the
Führer and his gentlemen were there. I was doubtful at that
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span>
time, but it was their opinion that the Communists had
started the fire.’</p>
<hr class='tbk420'/>
<p class='noindent'>“My question: ‘But you were the highest law enforcement
official in a certain sense. Daluege was your subordinate.
Looking back at it now, and not in the excitement that was
there once, wasn’t it too early to say without any investigation
that the Communists had started the fire?’</p>
<hr class='tbk421'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Göring: ‘Yes, that is possible, but the Führer wanted it this
way.’</p>
<hr class='tbk422'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘Why did the Führer want to issue at once a
statement that the Communists had started the fire?’</p>
<hr class='tbk423'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Answer: ‘He was convinced of it.’</p>
<hr class='tbk424'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘It is right when I say he was convinced without
having any evidence or any proof of that at this moment?’</p>
<hr class='tbk425'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Göring: ‘That is right, but you must take into account that
at that time the Communist activity was extremely strong,
that our new government as such was not very secure.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Kempner, what has that got to do with
Frick?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KEMPNER: He signed the decree, as I said before, abolishing
civil liberties on the morning after, pointing out that there
was a Communist danger. On the other side, this Communist danger
was a mere subterfuge and was one of the things which finally
led to the second World War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Frick not only abolished civil liberties within
Germany, but he also became the organizer of the huge police
network of the Nazi Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parenthetically, I may state that before this time there was no
unified Reich police system; the individual German states had police
forces of their own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice of the decree of
June 17, 1936, signed by Frick and published in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
1936, Page 487. An English translation of this decree is in the
document book under Document Number 2073-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Section 1 of this Frick decree reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“For the unification of police duties in the Reich, a Chief of
German Police is appointed in the Reich Ministry of the
Interior, to whom is assigned the direction and conduct of
all police affairs.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And from Section 2 we learn that it was the Defendant Frick
and Hitler, the signers of the decree, who appointed Himmler as
Chief of the German Police.
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 2 of Section 2 of the decree states that Himmler
was, and I quote, “subordinated individually and directly to the
Reich and Prussian Minister of the Interior.” And of course that
is Frick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The official chart of the German Police system, Document
1852-PS, which has already been introduced into evidence as Exhibit
Number USA-449, clearly shows the position of the Reich Minister
of the Interior, Frick, as the supreme commander of the entire
German Police system, including the notorious RSHA, of which the
Defendant Kaltenbrunner became chief, under Frick, in January 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Frick used his authority over the newly centralized
police system for the promotion of the Nazi conspiracy.
The Tribunal may take judicial notice of Frick’s decree of September
20, 1936, published in the <span class='it'>Ministerial Gazette of the Reich</span>
(<span class='it'>Ministerialblatt des Reichs-&nbsp;und Preussischen Ministeriums des
Innern</span>), 1936, Page 1343, Document 2245-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this decree Frick reserved for himself the authority to appoint
inspectors of the security police, subordinated them to his district
governors, the Oberpräsidenten, and ordered them to have a close
co-operation with the Party and the Armed Forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another example of the use of his activities in the police sphere
is in his ordinance of March 18, 1938, concerning the Austrian
Anschluss, in which Frick authorized the Reichsführer of the SS and
Police, Himmler, to take security measures in Austria without
regard to previous legal limitations. This decree is published in
the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1938, Page 262, and appears in the document
book as Document Number 1437-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not here repeat the evidence concerning the criminal
activities of the German police, over which the Defendant Frick
had supreme authority. I should simply like to refer the Tribunal
to the presentations already made on the subject of concentration
camps and the Gestapo, two of the police institutions under Frick’s
jurisdiction. But I should like to show that not only Himmler’s
subordinate machine but also Frick’s ministry itself was familiar
with these institutions. Therefore, I now offer into evidence
Document 1643-PS, as Exhibit Number USA-713.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document is a synopsis of correspondence between the
Reich Ministry of the Interior and its field offices, from November
1942 through August 1943, on the subject of the legal aspects of
the confiscation of property by the SS for the enlargement of the
concentration camp at Auschwitz. At the bottom of Page 1 and
the top of Page 2 of the English translation there appears a synopsis
of the minutes of a meeting held on December 17 and 18, 1942,
concerning the confiscation of this property. These minutes indicate
that a further discussion was to be held on the subject
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>
on 21 December 1942, between the representatives of the Reich
Minister of the Interior and the Reichsführer SS. On Page 2 there
appears also a summary of a teletype letter dated January 22, 1943
from Dr. Hoffmann, representing the Reich Minister of the Interior,
to the District Governor in Katowice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The summary begins as follows, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The territory of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp will
be changed into an independent estate”—which means an
administrative territory of itself.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The fact that the Defendant Frick demonstrated personal
interest in a concentration camp became known through the testimony
of Dr. Blaha, to which I should like to refer the Tribunal,
in which he testified that Frick visited the Dachau Camp in 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next aspect of the participation of the Defendant Frick
in the Nazi conspiracy concerns his promotion of racial persecution
and racism, involving the wiping out of the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to the many other responsibilities of Frick, this
vast administrative empire covered the entire area of the enactment
and administration of racial legislation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I refer again to Document 3475-PS, <span class='it'>The Manual for German
Administrative Officials</span>, previously introduced, and I refer to Pages
2 and 4, showing that Frick was administrative and legislative
guardian and protector of the German race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to avoid any repetition, I shall not quote the various
acts drafted by Frick’s ministry against the Jews. The presentation
concerning persecution of the Jews made by Major Walsh before
the Christmas recess listed a number of decrees signed by Frick,
including the infamous Nuremberg Laws and the laws depriving
Jews of their property, their rights of citizenship and stigmatizing
them with the Yellow Star.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the activities of Frick’s ministry were not restricted to
the commission of such crimes, camouflaged in the form of legislation.
The police field offices, subordinate to Frick, participated
in the organization of such terroristic activities as the pogrom of
November 9, 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I refer to a series of Heydrich’s orders and reports concerning
the organization of these pogroms or, as they were termed by
Heydrich, “spontaneous riots,” Documents 3051-PS and 3058-PS,
which are already in evidence as Exhibit Numbers USA-240 and 508.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three days after this pogrom of 9 November 1938 Frick, his
undersecretary Stuckart, and his subordinates, Heydrich and
Daluege, participated in a conference on the Jewish question under
the chairmanship of the Defendant Göring. At this meeting were
discussed the various measures which the individual governmental
<span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span>
departments should initiate against the Jews. A stenographic record
of this meeting, Document 1816-PS, is already in evidence as Exhibit
Number USA-261. May I briefly refer to the bottom of Page 23
of the English translation, where we find Göring’s concluding
remarks:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Also the Ministry of the Interior and the Police will have
to think over what measures have to be taken.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This remark shows that Göring regarded it as Frick’s duty
to follow-up by administrative devices the pogrom, organized by
Frick’s own subordinates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the foregoing presentation we have shown that the Defendant
Frick, as a member of the conspiracy, devised the machinery of
the State for Nazism. In the following presentation we will show
that Frick actively supported the preparation of the Nazi State
for war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May we begin this portion by showing that Frick was in
sympathy with the flagrant violations by Germany of her treaties
of non-aggression. This is clearly shown by the affidavit of Ambassador
Messersmith, Document 2385-PS, previously introduced as
Exhibit Number USA-68. I shall quote only one sentence from
this affidavit, Page 4, line 10. It reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“High-ranking Nazis with whom I had to maintain official
contact, particularly men such as Göring, Goebbels, Ley, Frick,
Frank, Darré, and others repeatedly scoffed at my position
as to the binding character of treaties and openly stated to
me that Germany would observe her international undertakings
only so long as it suited Germany’s interests to do so.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In May 1935, by his appointment as Plenipotentiary General
for the administration of the Reich, Frick became one of the big
three in charge of preparing Germany for war. The other two
members of the triumvirate were the Chief of the OKW and the
Plenipotentiary General for War Economy, at that time the Defendant
Schacht. Frick has admitted that he held the position of
Plenipotentiary General since 21 May 1935, the date of the original
secret Reich Defense Law. I refer to his statement of positions,
Document 2978-PS, Exhibit Number USA-8.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His functions as Plenipotentiary General are outlined in the
Reich Defense Law of 4 September 1938, which was classified top
military secret and appears in our document book as 2194-PS,
Exhibit Number USA-36. Under this law of 1938, Paragraph 3,
tremendous power was concentrated in the hands of Frick as
Plenipotentiary General for Administration. In addition to the
offices under his supervision as Minister of the Interior, the law
made the following offices subordinate to Frick for the purpose of
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span>
carrying out the directives of the law: Reich Minister of Justice,
Reich Minister of Education, Reich Minister for Religious Matters,
and the Reich Minister for Planning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frick admitted the significant part he played in the preparations
for war as a member of the triumvirate in a speech made on 7 March
1940 at the University of Freiburg. Excerpts appear in the document
book as Document Number 2608-PS, which I offer in evidence as
Exhibit Number USA-714. I think it would be helpful if the Tribunal
would allow me to read two short paragraphs, beginning at the top
of Page 1 of the English translation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The organization of the non-military national defense fits
organically into the entire structure of the National Socialist
Government and administration. This state of affairs is not
exceptional, but a necessary and planned part of the National
Socialist order. Thus, the conversion of our administration and
economy to wartime conditions has been accomplished very
quickly and without any friction—avoiding the otherwise very
dangerous change of the entire structure of the State.</p>
<hr class='tbk426'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The planned preparation of the administration for the possibility
of a war has already been carried out during peacetime.
For this purpose the Führer appointed a Plenipotentiary
General for the Reich Administration and a Plenipotentiary
General for War Economy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Many of Frick’s contributions to the preparation of the German
State for war are outlined in detail in the book <span class='it'>Dr. Wilhelm Frick
and His Ministry</span>, which is already in evidence as Document 3119-PS.
May I quote two short sentences from the top of Page 3 of the
English translation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Besides, the leading co-operation of the Reich Minister of the
Interior in the important field of ‘military legislation,’ and thus
in the establishment of our Armed Forces, has to be particularly
emphasized. After all, the Reich Minister of the Interior
is the civilian minister of the defense of the country, who in
this capacity, together with the Reich War Minister, not only
signed the military law of 21 May 1935 but, in his capacity
as Supreme Chief of the General and Inner Administration as
well as of the Police, has also received from the Führer and
Reich Chancellor important powers in the fields of the
recruitment system and of military supervision.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I have previously mentioned that as Minister of the Interior Frick
was responsible for the administrative policy in occupied and
annexed territories. It was his ministry which introduced the new
German order throughout the vast territory of Europe occupied by
the German Armed Forces, and the Defendant Frick exercised these
powers. I request that the Tribunal take judicial notice of three
<span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span>
decrees signed by Frick, introducing German law into Austria, the
Sudetenland, and the Government General of Poland respectively:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Decree of 13 March 1938, <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1938, Part I, Page 237,
Article 8, Document 2307-PS; decree of 1 October 1938, <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
1938, Part I, Page 1331, Paragraph 8, Document 3073-PS;
decree of 12 October 1939, <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1939, Part I, Page 2077,
Paragraph 8 (1), Document 3079-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frick’s ministry also arranged the selection and assignment of
hundreds of occupation officials for the Soviet territory even before
the invasion. This fact appears in a report by the Defendant
Rosenberg of April 1941 on preparations for the administration of
occupied territory in the East. May I refer to Page 2, Paragraph 2,
of Document 1039-PS, which has previously been introduced as
Exhibit Number USA-146.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One category of Frick’s contribution to the planning of, and
preparation for, aggressive war deserves special notice. This is the
systematic killing of persons regarded as useless to the German war
machine, such as the insane, the crippled, and aged, and foreign
laborers who were no longer able to work. These killings were
carried out in nursing homes, hospitals, and asylums. The Tribunal
will recall that the Defendant Frick, in his capacity as Reich Minister
of the Interior, had jurisdiction over public health and all institutions.
May I refer again briefly to the <span class='it'>Manual for German Administrative
Officials</span>, Document 3475-PS, this time to Pages 3, 4, and 7 of the
English partial translation. There the following are mentioned
as Frick’s jurisdictional areas: “Health Administration,” “Social
Hygiene,” “Racial Improvement and Eugenics,” “Reich Plenipotentiary
for Sanatoria and Nursing Homes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As proof that Frick’s jurisdiction covered the death cases in these
institutions, I now offer in evidence Document 621-PS, Exhibit
Number USA-715. This is a letter of 2 October 1940 from the Chief
of the Reich Chancellery, Dr. Lammers, to the Reich Minister of
Justice, informing the latter that material concerning the death of
inmates of nursing homes had been transmitted to the Reich Minister
of the Interior for further action. In fact, the Defendant Frick not
only had jurisdiction of these establishments, but he was one of the
originators of a secret law organizing the murdering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now offer Document 1556-PS, Exhibit Number USA-716. This
is an official report, dated December 1941, of the Czechoslovak War
Crimes Commission entitled, “Detailed Statement on the Murdering
of Ill and Aged People in Germany.” I should like to quote very
brief excerpts from this report. Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 read as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1) The murdering can be traced back to a secret law which
was released some time in the summer of 1940.
<span class='pageno' title='363' id='Page_363'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk427'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2) Besides the Chief Physician of the Reich, Dr. L. Conti,
the Reichsführer SS Himmler, the Reich Minister of the Interior
Dr. Frick, as well as other men, the following participated in
the introduction of this secret law:.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”—Other names listed.</p>
<hr class='tbk428'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3) As I have already stated, there were—after careful calculation—at
least 200,000, mainly mentally deficient, imbeciles,
besides neurological cases and medically unfit people—these
were not only incurable cases—and at least 75,000 aged
people.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The most striking example of the continued killings in these
institutions, which were under Frick’s jurisdiction and operated
under the order of which Frick was a co-author, is the famous
Hadamar case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your Honor, may I ask you whether I may have 10 more minutes
to end this presentation, because the Chief Prosecutors agreed, as
I understood, to start tomorrow morning the case of the French, and
I have just 10 more minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KEMPNER: Thank you, Your Lordship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I refer to the Hadamar case. I now offer in evidence Document
Number 615-PS, Exhibit Number USA-717.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): What is this last report that you
spoke about? Whose is it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KEMPNER: The Czechoslovak War Crimes Commission
report. After I have shown the general scheme, of which Frick was
a co-author, I would like to show that Frick’s ministry was
acquainted with the things that were going on under his organizational
authorship; and therefore I am quoting now a letter to the
fact that he was acquainted with these killings and that these killings
had even become public knowledge. For this reason I offer in
evidence Document 615-PS, Exhibit number USA-717. This document
is a letter from the Bishop of Limburg of 13 August 1941 to the
Reich Minister of Justice. Copies were sent to the Reich Minister of
the Interior—this means Frick—and to the Reich Minister for Church
Affairs. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“About 8 kilometers from Limburg, in the little town of
Hadamar, on a hill overlooking the town, there is an institution
which had formerly served various purposes and of late had
been used as a nursing home; this institution was renovated
and furnished as a place in which, by consensus of opinion, the
above-mentioned euthanasia has been systematically practiced
for months, approximately since February 1941. The fact has
<span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span>
become known beyond the administrative district of Wiesbaden,
because death certificates from a Registry Hadamar-Moenchberg
are sent to the home communities.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And I quote further:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Several times a week buses arrive in Hadamar with a
considerable number of such victims. School children of the
vicinity know this vehicle and say, ‘There comes the murder-box
again.’ After the arrival of the vehicle, the citizens of
Hadamar watch the smoke rise out of the chimney and are
tortured with the ever-present thought of the miserable
victims, especially when repulsive odors annoy them, depending
on the direction of the wind.</p>
<hr class='tbk429'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The effect of the principles at work here, are: Children call
each other names and say, ‘You’re crazy; you’ll be sent to the
baking oven in Hadamar.’ Those who do not want to marry
or find no opportunity say, ‘Marry, never! Bring children
into the world so they can be put into the bottling machine!’
You hear old folks say, ‘Don’t send me to a state hospital!
After the feeble-minded have been finished off, the next
useless eaters whose turn will come are the old people.’</p>
<hr class='tbk430'/>
<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The population cannot grasp that systematic actions are
carried out which, in accordance with Paragraph 211 of the
German criminal code, are punishable with, death! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk431'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Officials of the Secret State Police, it is said, are trying to
suppress discussion of the Hadamar occurrences by means of
severe threats. In the interest of public peace this may be
well intended. But the knowledge and the conviction and the
indignation of the population cannot be changed by it; the
conviction will be increased with the bitter realization that
discussion is prohibited with threats but that the actions
themselves are not prosecuted under penal law.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I quote the last paragraph of the letter, the postscript:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I am submitting copies of this letter to the Reich Minister
for Church Affairs.” Initialed by above.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, the killings carried out in these institutions under
the secret law created by Defendants Frick, Himmler, and others
continued year after year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Was any answer made to that letter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KEMPNER: No answer has been found. I have other letters
which I am not able to quote here today which have the remark,
“Please don’t answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: “Please don’t answer”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KEMPNER: That it should be unanswered.
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, the killings carried out in these institutions under
the secret law created by Defendants Frick, Himmler, and others
continued year after year. I offer in evidence Document 3592-PS,
Exhibit Number USA-718, which is a certified copy of the charge,
specifications, findings, and sentence of the U.S. Military Commission
at Wiesbaden, against the individuals who operated the Hadamar
Sanatorium, where many Russians and Poles were murdered. In
this particular proceeding seven defendants were charged with the
murder in 1944 of 400 persons of Polish and Russian nationality, and
three of the defendants were sentenced to be hanged; the other four
were sentenced to confinement at hard labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I come to the last page of my presentation, the final case
of Frick’s responsibility, which arises under his position as Reich
Protector of Bohemia and Moravia for the period from August 20,
1943, until the end of the war. I think it is not necessary to say
anything about the functions of the Protector of Bohemia and
Moravia; these broad powers are known to the Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Before you pass from 3592-PS, is it clear that
that trial relates to the killing of Polish and Russian nationals in
nursing homes or institutions of that sort?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KEMPNER: It is absolutely clear in this document, the
sentence of the Military Commission of Hadamar for Wiesbaden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you show me where that is?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KEMPNER: Document Number 3592-PS. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Specification: In that Alfons Klein, Adolf Wahlmann, Heinrich
Ruoff, Karl Willig, Adolf Merkle, Irmgard Huber, and Philipp
Blum, acting jointly and in pursuance of a common intent and
acting for and on behalf of the then German Reich, did, from
or about July 1, 1944, until about April 1, 1945, at Hadamar,
Germany, wilfully, deliberately, and wrongfully aid, abet, and
participate in the killing of human beings of Polish and
Russian nationality; their exact names and number being unknown,
but aggregating in excess of 400, and who were then
and there confined by the German Reich as an exercise of
belligerent control.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It doesn’t show that it came within the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KEMPNER: Some time ago I referred to the manual of the
German administrative officials. This manual points out very clearly
that nursing homes, sanitaria, and similar establishments are under
the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I follow that, but this document does not
refer to nursing homes. That is what I was asking you.
<span class='pageno' title='366' id='Page_366'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KEMPNER: Yes, it says only Hadamar. It is, in fact, the
Hadamar Nursing Home. This portion wasn’t given by the Judge
Advocate General, but I am willing to give later a more extended
document that Hadamar is a common name for the so-called Hadamar
killing mill, which is a nursing home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I come to the last paragraph of my presentation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a moment, Dr. Kempner. Counsel for
the Defense wishes to speak. There is a gentleman standing by
your side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: From Document 3592-PS, which was just
read, I cannot find that the Defendant Frick is connected with the
document in any way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Surely it is not necessary for you to get up
and repeat what I have just said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: I would like to add something else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I beg your pardon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: I would like to add that the Defendant
Frick since August 1943 was not Minister of the Interior, and for
that reason this document cannot be used against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And it does not give the date of the death of
these people. At any rate, until Dr. Kempner produces something
to show that this was a nursing home and in a time during which
the Defendant Frick was Minister of the Interior, the Tribunal will
not treat it as being evidence which implicates Frick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KEMPNER: I quoted this killing in Hadamar for two reasons:
First, because the Ministry of the Interior has become acquainted,
as I said before, with the letter of the Bishop of Limburg, in 1941,
when Frick was Minister of the Interior and knew about these facts;
and I quoted the military decision for this reason, that these killings
were still going on in 1944 and 1945 under a law of which the
Defendant Frick was the co-author.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The final phase of Frick’s responsibility arises under his position
as Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia for the period from 20
August 1943 until the end of the war. I have not to prove his
function but I shall mention one example, and I offer in evidence
Document Number 3589-PS, Exhibit Number USA-720, which is a
supplement to an official Czechoslovak report on German crimes
against Czechoslovakia. I would like to quote only the following
brief passage from this report:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the tenure of office of Defendant Wilhelm Frick as
Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia from August 1943
until the liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945 many thousands
<span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span>
of Czechoslovak Jews were transported from the Terezin
ghetto in Czechoslovakia to the concentration camp at
Oswieczim (Auschwitz) in Poland and were there killed in
the gas chambers.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Brought from the territory over which Frick was Protector to
the gas chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, we submit, it has been shown that the Defendant Frick
was a key conspirator from 1923 until the Allied armies crushed the
resistance of the Nazi Armed Forces. Frick’s guilt rests on his own
record and on the record of his co-defendants, for whom he is co-responsible
under our Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like to express my appreciation for the assistance
rendered in connection with the preparation of this case by my
colleagues Mr. Karl Lachmann, Lieutenant Frederick Felton, and
Captain Seymour Krieger.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 17 January 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span><h1>THIRTY-SIXTH DAY<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>Thursday, 17 January 1946</span></h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I call upon the Counsel for France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FRANCOIS DE MENTHON (Chief Prosecutor for the French
Republic): The conscience of the peoples, who only yesterday were
enslaved and tortured both in soul and body, calls upon you to
judge and to condemn the most monstrous attempt at domination
and barbarism of all times, both in the persons of some of those who
bear the chief responsibility and in the collective groups and
organizations which were the essential instruments of their crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>France, invaded twice in 30 years in the course of wars, both of
which were launched by German imperialism, bore almost alone in
May and June 1940 the weight of armaments accumulated by Nazi
Germany over a period of years in a spirit of aggression. Although
temporarily crushed by superiority in numbers, material, and preparation,
my country never gave up the battle for freedom and was
at no time absent from the field. The engagements undertaken and
the will for national independence would have sufficed to keep
France behind General De Gaulle in the camp of the democratic
nations. If, however, our fight for freedom slowly took the shape of
a popular uprising, at the call of the men of the Resistance, belonging
to all social classes, to all creeds and to all political parties, it
was because, while our soil and our souls were crushed by the Nazi
invader, our people refused not only to submit to wretchedness and
slavery, but even more they refused to accept the Hitlerian dogmas
which were in absolute contradiction to their traditions, their
aspirations, and their human calling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>France, which was systematically plundered and ruined; France,
so many of whose sons were tortured and murdered in the jails of
the Gestapo or in concentration camps; France, which was subjected
to the still more horrible grip of demoralization and return to
barbarism diabolically imposed by Nazi Germany, asks you, above
all in the name of the heroic martyrs of the Resistance, who are
among the greatest heroes of our national legend, that justice be
done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>France, so often in history the spokesman and the champion of
human liberty, of human values, of human progress, through my
voice today also becomes the interpreter of the martyred peoples
<span class='pageno' title='369' id='Page_369'></span>
of western Europe, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Luxembourg, peoples more than all others devoted to peace, peoples
who are among the noblest of humanity by their aspirations and
their worship of the values of civilization, peoples who have shared
our sufferings and have refused, like us, to give up liberty and to
sacrifice their souls before the assault of Nazi barbarism. France
here becomes their interpreter to demand that real justice be done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The craving for justice of the tortured peoples is the basic
foundation of France’s appearance before Your High Tribunal. It
is not the only one, nor perhaps the most important one. More than
toward the past, our eyes are turned toward the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We believe that there can be no lasting peace and no certain
progress for humanity, which still today is torn asunder, suffering,
and anguished, except through the co-operation of all peoples and
through the progressive establishment of a real international society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Technical procedures and diplomatic arrangements will not
suffice. There can be no well balanced and enduring nation without
a common consent in the essential rules of social living, without a
general standard of behavior before the claims of conscience, without
the adherence of all citizens to identical concepts of good and of evil.
There is no domestic law which, in defining and punishing criminal
violations, is not founded on criteria of a moral order which is
accepted by all—in a word, without a common morality. There can
be no society of nations tomorrow without an international morality,
without a certain community of spiritual civilization, without an
identical hierarchy of values; international law will be called upon
to recognize and guarantee the punishment of the gravest violations
of the universally accepted moral laws. This morality and this international
criminal law, indispensable for the final establishment of
peaceful co-operation and of progress on lasting foundations, are
inconceivable to us today after the experience of past centuries and
more especially of these last years, after the incredible and awesome
sacrifices and the sufferings of men of all races and of all nationalities,
except as built on the respect of the human person, of every
human person whosoever he may be, as well as on the limitation
of the sovereignty of states.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in order that we may have the hope of founding progressively
an international society, through the free co-operation of
all peoples, founded on this morality and on this international law,
it is necessary that, after having premeditated, prepared, and
launched a war of aggression which has caused the death of millions
of men and the ruin of a great number of nations, after having
thereupon piled up the most odious crimes in the course of the war
years, Nazi Germany shall be declared guilty and her rulers and
those chiefly responsible punished as such. Without this sentence and
<span class='pageno' title='370' id='Page_370'></span>
without this punishment the people would no longer have any faith
in justice. When you have declared that crime is always a crime,
whether committed by one national entity against another or by
one individual against another, you will thereby have affirmed that
there is only one standard of morality, which applies to international
relations as well as to individual relations, and that on this morality
are built prescriptions of law recognized by the international community;
you will then have truly begun to establish an international
justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This work of justice is equally indispensable for the future of the
German people. These people have been for many years intoxicated
by Nazism; certain of their eternal and deep seated aspirations,
under this regime, have found a monstrous expression; their entire
responsibility is involved, not only by their general acceptance but
by the effective participation of a great number of them in the
crimes committed. Their re-education is indispensable. This represents
a difficult enterprise and one of long duration. The efforts which
the free peoples will have to make in order to reintegrate Germany
into an international community cannot succeed in the end if this
re-education is not carried out effectively. The initial condemnation
of Nazi Germany by your High Tribunal will be a first lesson for
these people and will constitute the best starting point for the work
of the revision of values and of re-education which must be its
great concern during the coming years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is why France sees fit to ask the Tribunal to qualify juridically
as crimes, both the war of aggression itself and those acts in
violation of the morality and of the laws of all civilized countries
which have been committed by Germany in the conduct of the war,
to condemn those who are chiefly responsible, and to declare criminal
the members of the various groups and organizations which were
the principal perpetrators of the crimes of Nazi Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your High Tribunal, established by the four nations signatory
to the agreement of 8 August 1945, acting in the interests of all the
United Nations, is qualified to mete out to Nazi Germany the justice
of the free peoples, the justice of liberated humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The establishment by our four governments of a Tribunal competent
to judge the crimes committed by those principally responsible
in Nazi Germany is based solidly on the principles and usage of
international law. As an eminent British jurist has recently reminded
us: The practice and the doctrine of international law have always
given to belligerent states the right to punish enemy war criminals
who fall into their power. It is an immutable rule of international
law which no author has ever contested. It is not a new doctrine.
It was born with the birth of international law. Francisco de
<span class='pageno' title='371' id='Page_371'></span>
Vittoria and Grotius laid its foundations. The German authors of
the 17th and 18th century developed the doctrine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Johann Jacob Moser, a positivist writer of the 18th century
said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Enemy soldiers who act in violation of international law,
should they fall into the hands of their adversaries, are not
to be treated as prisoners of war. They can suffer the same
fate as thieves or murderers.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The prosecutions which the United States, Great Britain, the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and France are today carrying
out against the men and the organizations appearing before Your
High Tribunal under the Indictment read in Berlin on 18 October
1945, therefore have an unimpeachable juridical foundation: The
right, universally recognized by international doctrine, of bringing
war criminals before a punitive jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This right is strengthened by legal considerations that are perhaps
even more irrefutable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The principle of the territorial application of penal laws gives to
every state the right to punish crimes committed on its territory.
The application of the territorial principle covers the violations of
international law in territory subject to military occupation; these
violations are the chief source of war crimes. But the crimes committed
by the defendants were not directed against any given state,
in any given occupied territory. The National Socialist conspirators,
against whom we ask that justice be done, directed the policy of the
Third Reich. All the states which were occupied and temporarily
enslaved by their armed forces have been equally victims both of
the illicit war which they launched and of the methods used by them
in the conduct of this war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is therefore no single state which could legitimately claim
the privilege of trying these criminals. Only an International Tribunal,
emanating from the combined United Nations, which were
yesterday at war with Germany, can rightly claim this privilege. This
is why the declaration on enemy atrocities made at the end of the
Moscow Conference in October 1943 had provided that the leaders
of Nazi Germany would, after the joint victory of the Allies, be
brought before an international jurisdiction. There is, therefore,
nothing new from a juridical point of view in the principle of justice
which you are called upon to render. Far from being merely an
affirmation of power on the part of the victors, your competence is
founded on the recognition by international law of the territorial
jurisdiction of sovereign states.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The transfer by these states of their juridical power to an
international court constitutes a notable progress in the setting up
<span class='pageno' title='372' id='Page_372'></span>
of an inter-state punitive procedure. It does not constitute any
innovation in the legal foundation of the justice which you are called
upon to render.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The penal qualification of the facts may seem more open to
juridical objections. This horrible accumulation and maze of Crimes
against Humanity both include and go beyond the two more precise
juridical notions of Crimes against Peace and War Crimes. But I
think—and I will revert later separately to Crimes against Peace
and War Crimes—that this body of Crimes against Humanity constitutes,
in the last analysis, nothing less than the perpetration for
political ends and in a systematic manner, of common law crimes
such as theft, looting, ill treatment, enslavement, murders, and
assassinations, crimes that are provided for and punishable under
the penal laws of all civilized states.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No general objection of a juridical nature, therefore, appears to
hamper your task of justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, the Nazis accused would have no ground to argue on
alleged lack of written texts to justify the penal qualification that
you will apply to their crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Has not the juridical doctrine of National Socialism admitted that
in domestic criminal law even the judge can and must supplement
the law? The written law no longer constituted the Magna Charta
of the delinquent. The judge could punish when, in the absence of
a provision for punishment, the National Socialist sense of justice
was gravely offended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How could a judge under the Nazi regime supplement the law?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his search for a semi-legal solution he acted in the manner of
a legislator. Proceeding from the firm basis of the National Socialist
program, he sought the rule which he would have proclaimed had
he been a legislator. The Defendant Frank, in his speech at the
Juristentag in 1936, declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Say to yourself at each decision you have to make: How
would the Führer decide in my place? For every decision
which you have to make, ask yourself: Is this decision in
accordance with the National Socialist conscience of the German
people? Thus you will have a firm basis of conscience
which will also bear for all time, in your own sphere of
decisions, the authority of the Third Reich, based on the
popular National Socialist unity and on the recognition of the
will of the Führer Adolf Hitler.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To those who tomorrow will render justice in the name of human
conscience, the Defendant Frank and his accomplices would be ill
advised to protest against a lack of written texts with appropriate
<span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span>
sanctions, especially since, in addition to various international conventions,
these texts, though they be not codified in an inter-state
penal code, exist in the penal code of every civilized country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Justice Jackson has given you the details of the various
phases and aspects of the National Socialist plot, its planning and
its development, from the first days of the conspiracy of Hitler and
his companions to rise to power, until the unleashing of innumerable
crimes in a Europe almost entirely at their mercy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Hartley Shawcross then enumerated the various breaches of
treaties, of agreements, of promises which were the prelude to the
many wars of aggression of which Germany was guilty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I propose today to prove to you that all this organized and vast
criminality springs from what I may be allowed to call a crime
against the spirit, I mean a doctrine which, denying all spiritual,
rational, or moral values by which the nations have tried, for thousands
of years, to improve human conditions, aims to plunge
humanity back into barbarism, no longer the natural and spontaneous
barbarism of primitive nations, but into a diabolical barbarism,
conscious of itself and utilizing for its ends all material
means put at the disposal of mankind by contemporary science. This
sin against the spirit is the original sin of National Socialism from
which all crimes spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This monstrous doctrine is that of racialism: The German race,
composed in theory of Aryans, would be a fundamental and natural
concept. Germans as individuals do not exist and cannot justify their
existence, except insofar as they belong to the race or Volkstum,
to the popular mass which represents and amalgamates all Germans.
Race is the matrix of the German people; proceeding therefrom
this people lives and develops as an organism. The German
may consider himself only as a healthy and vigorous member of this
body, fulfilling within the collectivity a definite technical function;
his activity and his usefulness are the exact gauge and justification
of his liberty. This national body must be “moulded” to prepare it
for a permanent struggle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ideas and the bodily symbols of racialism form an integral
part of its political system. This is what is called authoritative or
dictatorial biology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The expression “blood” which appears so often in the writings
of the Nazi theorists denotes this stream of real life, of red sap which
flows through the circulatory system of every race and of all genuine
culture as it flows through the human body. To be Aryan is to feel
this current passing through oneself, this current which galvanizes
and vivifies the whole nation. Blood is this region of spontaneous
and unconscious life which reveals to each individual the tendencies
of the race. The intellectual life must never, in extolling itself,
<span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>
separate us from this elemental basis of the sacred community. Let
the individual go into himself and he will receive by direct revelation
“the commandments of the blood.” Dreams, rites, and myths
can lead to this revelation. In other words the modern German can
and must bear in himself the call of the old Germany and find again
its purity and its youthful primitiveness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The body and soul unity (Leib Seele Einheit) of the individual
must not be disputed. One reads in the <span class='it'>Nationalsozialistische Monatshefte</span>
of September 1938 that the body belongs to the State and the
soul to the Church and to God. It is no longer so. The whole of the
individual, body and soul, belongs to the Germanic nation and to the
Germanic State. National Socialism affirms, indeed, that the moral
conscience is the result of ortho-genetic evolution, the consequence
of the most simple physiological functions which characterize the
individuality of the body. Therefore, the moral conscience is also
subject to heredity and consequently subject to the postulate and to
the demands of the race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>True, this pseudo-religion does not repudiate the means of reason
and of technical activity, but subordinates them rigorously, brings
them infallibly to the racial myth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The individual has no value in himself and is important only as
an element of the race. This affirmation is logical if one admits that
not only physical and psychological characteristics, but also opinions
and tendencies are bound, not to the individual but to the nation.
Anyone whose opinions differ from the official doctrine is asocial or
unhealthy. He is unhealthy because in the Nazi doctrine the nation
is equivalent to the race. Now, the characteristics of the race are
fixed. An exception in the formation from the spiritual or moral
point of view constitutes a malformation in the same way as does a
clubfoot or a harelip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is the totalitarian doctrine which reduces the individual to
nonexistence save by the race and for the race, without freedom
of action or any definite aim; totalitarian doctrine which excludes
every other concept, every other aspiration or requirement save
those connected with the race, totalitarian doctrine which eliminates
from the individual every other thought save that of the interest
of the race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>National Socialism ends in the absorption of the personality of
the citizen into that of the state and in the denial of any intrinsic
value of the human person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are brought back, as can be seen, to the most primitive ideas
of the savage tribe. All the values of civilization accumulated in the
course of centuries are rejected, all traditional ideas of morality,
justice, and law give way to the primacy of race, its instincts, its
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span>
needs and interests. The individual, his liberty, his rights and
aspirations, no longer have any real existence of their own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this conception of race it is easy to realize the gulf that
separates members of the German community from other men. The
diversity of the races becomes irreducible, and irreducible, too, the
hierarchy which sets apart the superior and the inferior races. The
Hitler regime has created a veritable chasm between the German
nation, the sole keeper of the racial treasure, and other nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between the Germanic community and the degenerate population
of an inferior variety of men there is no longer any common
measure. Human brotherhood is rejected, even more than all the
other traditional moral values.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How can one explain how Germany, fertilized through the
centuries by classic antiquity and Christianity, by the ideals of
liberty, equality, and social justice, by the common heritage of
western humanism to which she had brought such noble and precious
contributions, could have come to this astonishing return to
primitive barbarism?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to understand it and to try to eradicate forever from
the Germany of tomorrow the evil by which our entire civilization
came so near to perishing, it must be recalled that National
Socialism has deep and remote origins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mysticism of racial community was born of the spiritual
and moral crises which Germany underwent in the 19th century
and which abruptly broke out again in its economic and social
structure through a particularly rapid industrialization. National
Socialism is in reality one of the peaks of the moral and spiritual
crisis of modern humanity, convulsed by industrialization and technical
progress. Germany experienced this metamorphosis of economic
and social life not only with an extraordinary brutality but at a
time when she did not yet possess the political equilibrium and
the cultural unity which the other countries of western Europe
had achieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the inner and spiritual life was weakening, a cruel uncertainty
dominated human minds, an uncertainty admirably
defined by the term “Ratlosigkeit,” which cannot be translated into
French but which corresponds to our popular expression, “One no
longer knows in what saint to believe.” This is the spiritual cruelty
of the 19th century which so many Germans have described with a
tragic evocative power. A gaping void opens before the human soul,
disoriented by the search for new values.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The natural sciences and the sciences of the mind give birth to
absolute relativism; to a deep scepticism regarding the lasting
quality of values on which Western humanism has been nurtured
for centuries. A vulgar Darwinism prevails, bewilders, and befuddles
<span class='pageno' title='376' id='Page_376'></span>
the brain. The Germans cease to see in human groups and races
anything but isolated nuclei in perpetual struggle with one another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is in the name of decadence that the German spirit condemns
humanism. It sees in the value of humanism and in the elements
that derive from it only “maladies,” which it attributes to an
excess of intellectualism and abstraction of everything that
restrains men’s passions by subjecting them to common norms.
From this point on, classic antiquity is no longer considered in its
aspects of ordered reason or of radiant beauty. In it one sees only
civilizations violently enamored of struggles and rivalries, linked
especially to Germany through their so-called Germanic origin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sacerdotal Judaism and Christianity in all its forms are condemned
as religions of honor and brotherhood, calculated to kill the
virtues of brutal force in man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cry is raised against the democratic idealism of the modern
era, and then against all the internationals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over a people in this state of spiritual crisis and of negations
of traditional values the culminating philosophy of Nietzsche was
to exercise a dominant influence. In taking the will to power as a
point of departure, Nietzsche preached, certainly not inhumanity
but superhumanity. If there is no final cause in the universe, man,
whose body is matter which is at once feeling and thinking, may
mould the world to his desire, choosing as his guide a militant
biology. If the supreme end of humanity is a feeling of victorious
fullness which is both material and spiritual, all that remains is
to insure the selection of physical specimens, who become the new
aristocracy of masters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Nietzsche the industrial evolution necessarily entails the
rule of the masses, the automatism and the shaping of the working
multitudes. The state endures only by virtue of an elite of vigorous
personalities who, by the methods so admirably defined by
Machiavelli, which alone are in accord with the laws of life, will
lead men by force and by ruse simultaneously, for men are and
remain wicked and perverse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We see the modern barbarian arise. Superior by his intelligence
and his wilful energy, freed of all conventional ethics, he can
enforce upon the masses obedience and loyalty by making them
believe in the dignity and beauty of labor and by providing them
with that mediocre well-being with which they are so easily content.
An identical force will, therefore, be manifest in the leaders,
by the harmony between their elementary passions and the lucidity
of their organizing reason, and in the masses, whose dark or violent
instincts will be balanced by a reasoned activity imposed with
implacable discipline.
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Without doubt, the late philosophy of Nietzsche cannot be
identified with the brutal simplicity of National Socialism. Nevertheless,
National Socialism was wont to glorify Nietzsche as one
of its ancestors. And justly so, for he was the first to formulate
in a coherent manner criticism of the traditional values of
humanism; and also, because his conception of the government of
the masses by masters knowing no restraint is a preview of the
Nazi regime. Besides, Nietzsche believed in the sovereign race and
attributed primacy to Germany, whom he considered endowed with
a youthful soul and unquenchable resources.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The myth of racial community which had arisen from the depths
of the German soul, unbalanced by the moral and spiritual crises
endured by modern humanity, allied itself with the traditional
theses of Pan-Germanism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already Fichte’s speeches to the German nation exalting
Germanism clearly reveal one of the main ideas of Pan-Germanism,
namely, that Germany visualizes and organizes the world as it
should be visualized and organized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The apology for war is equally ancient. It dates back to Fichte
and Hegel, who had affirmed that war, through its classifying of
peoples, alone establishes justice among nations. For Hegel, in
<span class='it'>Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechtes</span>, Page 433, states: “The
moral health of nations is maintained thanks to war, just as the
passing breeze saves the sea from stagnation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The living space theory appears right at the beginning of the
19th century. It is a well-known geographical and historical
demonstration which such people as Ratzel, Arthur Dix, and
Lamprecht will take up later on, comparing conflicts between
peoples to a savage fight between conceptions and realizations of
space and declaring that all history is moving towards German
hegemony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>State totalitarianism also has ancient roots in Germany. The
absorption of individuals by the State was hoped for by Hegel,
who wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Individuals disappear in the presence of the universal
substance”—that is the people or state idea—“and this
substance itself shapes the individuals in accordance with
its own ends.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, National Socialism appears in present-day Germany
neither as a spontaneous formation which might be due to the
consequence of the defeat in 1918, nor as a mere invention of a
group of men determined upon seizing power. National Socialism
is the ultimate result of a long evolution of doctrines; the
exploitation by a group of men of one of the most profound and
most tragic aspects of the German soul. But the crime committed
<span class='pageno' title='378' id='Page_378'></span>
by Hitler and his companions will be precisely that of unleashing
and exploiting to its extreme limit the latent force of barbarity,
which existed before him in the German people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dictatorial regime instituted by Hitler and his companions
carries with it for all Germans the “soldier-life,” that is to say, a
kind and a system of life entirely different from that of the
bourgeois West and the proletarian East. It amounted to a
permanent and complete mobilization of individual and collective
energies. This integral militarization presupposed complete
uniformity of thoughts and actions. It is a militarization which
conforms to the Prussian tradition of discipline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Propaganda instils into the masses faith, drive, and a thirst
for the greatness of the community. Those consenting masses find
an artificial derivative for their moral anguish and their material
cares in theories of race and in a mystical exaltation held in
common. Souls which yesterday were wounded and rent asunder
once more find themselves united in a common mould.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi educational system moulds new generations which
show no trace of traditional moral teachings, those being replaced
by the cult of race and of strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The race myth tends to become a real national religion. Many
writers dream of substituting for the duality of religious confessions
a world-wide dogma of German conception, which would
amount to being the religion of the German race as a race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the middle of the 20th century Germany goes back, of her
own free will, beyond Christianity and civilization to the primitive
barbarity of ancient Germany. She makes a deliberate break with
all universal conceptions of modern nations. The National Socialist
doctrine, which raised inhumanity to the level of a principle, constitutes,
in fact, a doctrine of disintegration of modern society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This doctrine necessarily brought Germany to a war of aggression
and to the systematic use of criminality in the waging of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The absolute primacy of the German race, the negation of any
international law whatsoever, the cult of strength, the exacerbation
of community mysticism made Germany consider recourse to war,
in the interests of the German race, logical and justified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This race would have the incontestable right to grow at the
expense of nations considered decadent. Germany is about to
resume even in the middle of the 20th century the great invasions
of the barbarians. Moreover, most naturally and logically, she will
wage her war in barbarous fashion, not only because National
Socialist ethics are indifferent to the choice of means, but also
because war must be total in its means and in its ends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether we consider a Crime against Peace or War Crimes, we
are therefore not faced by an accidental or an occasional criminality
<span class='pageno' title='379' id='Page_379'></span>
which events could explain without justifying it. We are, in fact,
faced by systematic criminality, which derives directly and of
necessity from a monstrous doctrine put into practice with
deliberate intent by the masters of Nazi Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the National Socialist doctrine there arises directly the
immediately pursued perpetration of Crimes against Peace. As
early as February 1920, in the first program of the National Socialist
Party, Adolf Hitler had already outlined the future basis of German
foreign policy. But it was in 1924 in his Landsberg prison, while
writing <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, that he gave a fuller development to his
views.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> the foreign policy of the Reich must
have as its first objective to give back to Germany her
“independence and her effective sovereignty” which is clearly an
allusion to the articles of the Treaty of Versailles, referring to
disarmament and the demilitarization of the Rhineland. It would
then endeavor to reconquer the territories lost in 1919, and 15 years
before the outbreak of the second World War the question of Alsace
and Lorraine is clearly raised. It would also have to seek to extend
German territories in Europe, the frontiers of 1914 being “insufficient”
and it would be indispensable to extend them by including
“all Germans” in the Reich, beginning with the Germans of
Austria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After having reconstituted Greater Germany, National Socialism
will do everything necessary to “insure the means of existence” on
this planet to the race forming the state, by means, of establishing
a “healthy relation” between the size of the population and the
extent of the territory. By “healthy relation” is meant a situation
such that the subsistence of the people will be assured by the
resources of its own territory. “A sufficient living space on this
earth will alone insure to a people its liberty of existence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But so far that is but a stage.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“When a people sees its subsistence guaranteed by the extent
of its territory, it is nevertheless necessary to think of
insuring the security of that territory”—because the power
of a state “arises directly out of the military value of its
geographical situation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Those ends, Hitler adds, cannot be reached without war. It will
be impossible to obtain the re-establishment of the frontiers of
1914 “without bloodshed.” How much more impossible it would
be to acquire living space if one did not prepare for a “clash
of arms.”</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is in Eastern Europe, at the expense of Russia and the
neighboring countries that Germany must seek new territories.
We are stopping the eternal march of the Germans
<span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span>
towards the South and the West of Europe and are casting
our eyes towards the East.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But before anything, declares Hitler, it is necessary to crush
France’s tendency towards hegemony, and to have a “final settlement”
with this “mortal enemy.” “The annihilation of France will
enable Germany to acquire afterwards territories in the East.” The
“settlement of accounts” in the West is but a prelude. “It can be
explained only as the securing of our rear defenses in order to
extend our living space in Europe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henceforth, also, Germany will have to prevent the existence
near her territory of a “military power” which might become her
rival and to oppose “by all means” the formation of a state which
possibly might acquire sufficient strength to do so; and if that
state exists already, to “destroy” it is, for Germans, not only a
right but a duty. “Never permit”—recommends Hitler to his
compatriots, in a passage which he calls his political testament—“the
formation in Europe of two continental powers. In every
attempt to set up a second military power on Germany’s borders,
even if it were in the shape of a state which might possibly acquire
that power, you must see an attack on Germany.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>War to reconquer the territories lost in 1919, war to annihilate
the power of France, war to acquire living space in eastern Europe,
war, finally, against any state which would be or which might
become a counter-weight to the hegemony of the Reich, that is
the plan of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this way, from the inception of National Socialism, he does
not recoil from any of the certainties of war entailed by the
application of his doctrines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fact, from the moment of his accession to power, Hitler and
his companions devoted themselves to the military and diplomatic
preparation of the wars of aggression which they had resolved
to wage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is true that, even before the accession to power of the
National Socialists, Germany had shown her determination to
reconstruct her armed forces, notably in 1932 when, on the
occasion of the Disarmament Conference, she demanded “equality
of rights” as regards armament; and Germany had already secretly
violated the articles of the Treaty of Versailles regarding disarmament.
But after the arrival of Hitler to power, German rearmament
was to be carried out at a vastly different rate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 14 October 1933 the Reich left the Disarmament Conference
and made known 5 days later its decision to withdraw from the
League of Nations under the pretext that it was not granted
equality of rights in the matter of armament. France had, however,
expressed her readiness to accept equality of rights if Germany
<span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span>
would first consent to an international control which would enable
the actual level of existing armaments to be determined. Germany
very obviously did not wish to agree to this condition, for an
international control would have revealed the extent of the
rearmament already carried out in secret by the Reich in violation
of the treaties. As a matter of fact, at a cabinet meeting which
took place on 13 October 1933, the minutes of which have been
found, Hitler had declared that he wished to “torpedo” the Disarmament
Conference. Under these conditions it is not surprising
that the attempts made to resume negotiations with Germany after
her withdrawal ended in failure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When 18 months later Hitler’s government decided to re-establish
conscription and to create immediately an army which
would, on a peace establishment, comprise 36 divisions, as well
as to create a military air force, it was breaking the engagements
which Germany had undertaken by the Treaty of Versailles.
However, on 3 February 1935, France and Great Britain had
suggested to the Reich that it resume its place in the League of
Nations and prepare a general disarmament convention which
would have been substituted for the military Articles of the Treaty.
At the moment when Hitler was on the point of obtaining, by
means of free negotiation, the abolition of the “unilateral burden”
which, as he said, the Treaty of Versailles laid on Germany, he
preferred to escape any voluntary limitation and any control of
armaments by a deliberate violation of a treaty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When it decided on 7 March 1936 to denounce the Treaty of
Locarno and to reoccupy at once the demilitarized Rhineland area,
thereby violating Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles,
the German government alleged that in so doing it was replying
to the pact concluded and signed on 2 May 1935, between France
and the U.S.S.R., and ratified on 27 February 1936 by the French
Chamber of Deputies. It alleged that this pact was contrary to
the Treaty of Locarno. This was a mere pretext which was taken
seriously by nobody. The Nazi leaders wanted to start building the
Siegfried Line as soon as possible in the demilitarized Rhineland
area, in order to thwart a military intervention which France might
attempt in order to assist her Eastern allies. The decision of
7 March 1936 was the prelude to the aggressions directed against
Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Internally, rearmament was achieved thanks to a plan of economic
and financial measures which affected every aspect of
national life. The entire economic system was directed towards the
preparation of war. The members of the government proclaimed
priority of armaments manufacture over all other branches of
production. Policy took precedence over economics. The Führer
declared:
<span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The people must be resigned for some time to having its
butter, fats, and meat rationed in order that rearmament
may proceed at the desired rate.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The German people did not protest against this order. The state
intervened to increase the production of substitute goods which
would help to relieve the insufficiency of raw materials and would
enable the Reich, in the event of war, to maintain the level of
production necessary for the Army and Air Force, even if imports
were to become difficult or impossible. The Defendant Göring, in
September 1936, inspired the drawing up and directed the application
of the Four Year Plan which put Germany’s economic system
on a war footing. The expenses entailed by this rearmament were
assured thanks to the new system of work treaties. The Defendant
Schacht during the 3½ years he was at the head of the Reich
Ministry of Economics brought into being this financial machinery
and thereby played an outstanding role in military preparations as
he himself recalled, after he left the Ministry, in a speech that
he made in November 1938 at the Economic Council of the German
Academy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Germany thus succeeded in 3 years’ time in recreating a great
army and in creating on the technical plane an organization
entirely devoted to future war. On 5 November 1937, when
expounding his plan for home policy to his collaborators, Hitler
stated that rearmament was practically completed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would that be a convenient time to break
off? We will adjourn, then, for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>M. DE MENTHON: While Hitler’s government was giving to
the Reich the economic and financial means for a war of aggression
he was carrying on simultaneously the diplomatic preparation of
that war by endeavoring to reassure the threatened nations during
the period which was indispensable to him for rearmament and by
endeavoring also to keep apart his eventual adversaries one from
the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech on 17 May 1933, Hitler, while asking for a revision
of the Treaty of Versailles, declared that he had no intention of
obtaining it by force. He stated that he admitted “the legitimate
exigencies of all peoples” and asserted that he did not want to
“germanize those who are not Germans.” He wished to “respect
the rights of other nationalities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, concluded on 26 January
1934, which was to reassure for a time the Warsaw government
and to lull it into a state of false security, was principally intended
<span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span>
to bar French policy from any action. In a work published in 1939
entitled <span class='it'>Deutschlands Aussenpolitik 1933-39</span>, an official writer, Professor
Von Freytagh-Loringhoven, wrote that the essential purpose
of this pact was to paralyze the action of the Franco-Polish alliance
and to “overthrow the entire French system.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 26 May 1935, 10 days after denouncing the military clauses of
the Treaty of Versailles, Germany started negotiations with Great
Britain which were to result in the Naval Agreement of 18 June
1935, negotiations which were intended to reassure British public
opinion by showing it that, while the Reich was desirous of
becoming once more a great military power, it was not thinking
of reconstituting a powerful fleet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately following the plebiscite of 13 January 1935 which
decided the return of the Saar territory to the Reich, Hitler
formally declared “that he would make no further territorial
demands whatsoever on France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was to use the same tactics towards France until the end
of 1938. On 6 December 1938 Ribbentrop came to Paris to sign
the Franco-German Declaration which recognized “the frontiers as
definite” between the two countries, and which stated that the two
governments were resolved:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. under reservation of their particular relations with third
powers, to engage in mutual consultation in the event of
questions of common interests which might show a risk of
leading to international difficulties.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>He was then still hoping, to quote the French Ambassador in Berlin,
to “stabilize peace in the West in order to have a free hand in
the East.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did not Hitler make the same promises to Austria and Czechoslovakia?
He signed, on 11 July 1936, an agreement with the
Viennese government recognizing the independence of Austria, an
independence which he was to destroy 20 months later. By means
of the Munich Agreement on 29 September 1938, he promised
subsequently to guarantee the integrity of the Czech territory
which he invaded less than 6 months later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, as early as 5 November 1937, in a secret conference
held at the Reich Chancellery, Hitler had made known to
his collaborators that the hour had come to resolve by force the
problem of the living space required by Germany. The diplomatic
situation was favorable to Germany. She had acquired superiority
of armaments which ran the risk of being only temporary. Action
should be taken without further delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereupon started the series of aggressions which have already
been detailed before this Court. It has also been shown to you
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span>
that these various aggressions have been made in violation of international
treaties and of the principles of international law. As a
matter of fact, German propaganda did not challenge this at the
time. It merely stated that those treaties and those principles “had
lost any reality whatever with the passage of time.” In other
words, it simply denied the value of the word once pledged and
asserted that the principles which formed the basis of international
law had become obsolete. This is a reasoning which is in line with
the National Socialist doctrines which, as we have seen, do not
recognize any international law and state that any means is
justifiable if it is of a nature to serve the interests of the
German race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, it is worth while examining the various arguments
which German propaganda made use of to justify the long-planned
aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Germany set forth, first of all, her vital interests. Can she not
be excused for neglecting the rules of international law when she
was engaged in a struggle for the existence of her people? She
needed economic expansion. She had the right and the duty to
protect the German minorities abroad. She was obliged to ward
off the encirclement which the Western powers were directing
against the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Economic expansion was one of the reasons which Hitler put
forward, even to his direct associates, in the secret conferences
he held in 1937 and 1939 in the Reich Chancellery. “Economic
needs,” he said “are the basis of the policy of expansion of Italy
and of Japan. They also guide Germany.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But would not Hitler’s Germany have been able to seek to
satisfy these needs by peaceful means? Did she think of obtaining
new possibilities for her foreign commerce through commercial
negotiations? Hitler did not stop at such solutions. To solve the
German economic problems, he saw only one way—the acquisition
of agricultural territories—undoubtedly because he was incapable of
conceiving of these problems under any other form than that of
“war economy.” If he affirmed the necessity of obtaining this
“agricultural space”—to use his own words—it was because he saw
therein the means of obtaining for the German population the food
resources which would protect it against the consequences of a
blockade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The duty of protecting “the German minorities abroad” was the
favorite theme which Germany’s diplomacy made use of from 1937
to 1939. It could obviously not serve as an excuse for the destruction
of the Czechoslovakian State or for the establishment of the
“German Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia.” The fate of the
<span class='pageno' title='385' id='Page_385'></span>
“Sudeten Germans,” that of the “Danzig Germans” was the Leitmotiv
of the German press, of the Führer’s speeches, and of the
publications of Ribbentrop’s propaganda. Thus, is it necessary to
recall that in the secret conference of 5 November 1937, in which
Hitler draws up for his associates the plan of action to be carried
out against the Czechoslovakian State, he does not say one word
about the “Sudeten Germans” and to recall that in the conference
of 23 May 1939 he declares that Danzig is not the “principal point”
of the German-Polish controversy? The “right of nationalities” was,
therefore, in his mind only a propaganda method intended to mask
the real design, which was the conquest of “living space.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The encirclement directed by the Western Powers against the
Reich is the argument which Hitler used when, on 28 April 1939,
he denounced the Naval Agreement which he had concluded in
1935 with Great Britain. This thesis of encirclement occupied a
great deal of space in the German <span class='it'>White Book of 1939</span>, relative to
the origins of the war; but is it possible to speak of encirclement
when Germany had, in May 1939, obtained the alliance with Italy
and when, on 23 August 1939, she concluded the German-Russian
Pact, and can we forget that the diplomatic efforts of France and
of Great Britain in respect to Greece, Romania, Turkey, Poland,
are subsequent both to the destruction of the Czechoslovakian State
and to the beginning of the German-Polish diplomatic conflict. Had
not the British Prime Minister declared on 23 March 1939 before
the House of Commons that British policy had only two aims: To
prevent Germany from dominating Europe and “to oppose a
method which, by the threat of force, obliged the weak states to
renounce their independence”? What Hitler Germany called
“encirclement” was simply a fence, belatedly built in an attempt
to check measureless ambitions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But German propaganda did not limit itself to this. Did we
not see one of its spokesmen point to the contrast between the
passivity of France and Great Britain in September 1938 and the
resistance which they showed in 1939 to the Hitler policy, wherefrom
it was concluded that the peace would have been maintained if the
Western Powers had exercised pressure on Poland to bring it to
accept the German demands, as they had exercised pressure the
previous year on Czechoslovakia? A strange argument, which is
equivalent to saying that Germany would have been willing not
to make war if all the Powers had yielded to her will! Is it an
excuse for the perpetrators of these violations that France and
Great Britain had for a long time opposed the violations of international
law by Germany merely by platonic protests?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Public opinion in France and Great Britain, deceived by Hitler’s
declarations, may have believed that the designs of National
<span class='pageno' title='386' id='Page_386'></span>
Socialism contemplated only settling the fate of German minorities;
it may have hoped that there was a limit to German ambitions;
and, ignorant as they were of the secret plans of which we have
proof today, France and Great Britain allowed Germany to rearm
and reoccupy the Rhineland at the very moment when, according
to the testimony of Ribbentrop himself, a military reaction on their
part would, in March 1936, have placed the Reich in a critical
situation. They permitted the aggression of March and September
1938, and it required the destruction of the Czechoslovakian State
to make the scope of the German plans clear to the Allies. How
can one be astonished that their attitude then changed and they
decided to resist the German plans? How could one still claim that
the peace could have been “bought” in August 1939 by concessions,
since the German secret documents prove that Hitler was determined
to attack Poland as early as May 1939, and that he would
have been “deeply disappointed” if she had yielded, and that he
wished a general war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In reality, the war was implied by the coming to power of the
National Socialists. Their doctrine inevitably led to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Sir Hartley Shawcross forcefully brought out before Your
High Tribunal, a war of aggression is self-evidently a violation of
international law and, more particularly, a violation of the General
Treaty for the Renouncement of War of 27 August 1928, under the
name of the Paris Pact, or the Kellogg-Briand Pact, of which
Germany is one of the signatories. This pact continues to constitute
a part of international law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I reread Article I of this Treaty?</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The High Contracting Parties solemnly declare, in the name
of their respective peoples, that they condemn recourse to
war for the solution of international controversies and
renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their
reciprocal relations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>War of aggression thus ceased to be lawful in 1928.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Hartley Shawcross told you, with eloquence, that the Paris
Pact, a new law of civilized nations, was the foundation of a better
European order. The Paris Pact, which remains the fundamental
charter of the law of war, indeed marks an essential step in the
evolution of the relations between states. The Hague Conventions
had regulated the “law of the conduct of war.” They had instituted
the obligation of recourse to arbitration as a preliminary to any
conflict. They had, essentially, established a distinction between
acts of war to which international law and custom allow recourse
and those which it prohibits. The Hague Convention did not even
touch upon the principle of war which remained outside the legal
sphere. This is, in fact, what is brought into being by the Paris
<span class='pageno' title='387' id='Page_387'></span>
Pact, which regulates “the right of declaration of war.” Since 1928
the international law of war has emerged from its framework of
regulations. It has gone beyond the empiricism of the Hague Convention
to qualify the legal foundation of recourse to force. Every
war of aggression is illegal, and the men who bear the responsibility
for bringing it about place themselves by their own will beyond
the law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What does this mean, if not that all acts committed as a consequence
of this aggression for the carrying on of the struggle thus
undertaken will cease to have the juridical character of acts of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I quote this well-known passage from Pascal?</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Why do you kill me? Don’t you live on the other side of the
water? My friend, if you lived on this side, I would be an
assassin, and it would be unjust to kill you as I am doing,
but since you live on the other side, I am an honorable man,
and this is just.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Acts committed in the execution of a war are assaults on persons
and goods which are themselves prohibited but are sanctioned in
all legislations. The state of war could make them legitimate only
if the war itself was legitimate. Inasmuch as this is no longer the
case, since the Kellogg-Briand Pact, these acts become purely and
simply common law crimes. As Mr. Justice Jackson has already
argued before you with irrefutable logic, any recourse to war is a
recourse to means which are in themselves criminal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the whole spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. It was
intended to deprive the states which accepted it of the right of
having recourse, in their national interests, to a series of acts
directed against the physical persons or against the properties of
nationals of a foreign power. Given this formal commitment, those
who have ignored it have given the order to commit acts prohibited
by the common law of civilized states, and there is here involved
no special rule of international law like that which existed
previously and which left the said acts of war untouched by any
criminal qualifications.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A war perpetrated in violation of international law no longer
really possesses the juridical character of a war. It is truly an
act of gangsterism, a systematically criminal undertaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This war, or this would-be-war, is in itself not only a violation
of international law, but indeed a crime, since it signifies the
launching of this systematically criminal enterprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inasmuch as they could not legally have recourse to force, those
who dictated it, and who were the very organs of the state bound
by treaties, must be considered as the very source of the numerous
assaults upon life and property that are severely punished by all
penal law.
<span class='pageno' title='388' id='Page_388'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>One cannot, of course, deduce from the preceding the individual
responsibility of all the perpetrators of acts of violence. It is
obvious that, in an organized modern state, responsibility is
limited to those who act directly for the state, they alone being
in a position to estimate the lawfulness of the orders given. They
alone can be prosecuted and they must be prosecuted. International
law is sufficiently powerful that the prestige of the sovereignty of
states cannot reduce it to impotence. It is not possible to maintain
that crimes against international law must escape repressive action
because, on the one hand, the state is an entity to which one cannot
impute criminal intention and upon which one cannot inflict punishment
and, on the other, no individual can be held responsible for
the acts of the state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, it cannot be objected that, despite the
illegality of the principle of recourse to force by Germany, other
states have admitted that war existed and speak of the application
of international law in time of war. It must, in fact, be noted that,
even in the case of civil war, the parties have often invoked these
rules which, to a certain extent, canalize the use of force. This
in no wise implies acquiescence in the principle of its use.
Moreover, when Great Britain and France communicated to the
League of Nations the fact that a state of war existed between
them and Germany as of 3 September 1939, they also declared that
in committing an act of aggression against Poland, Germany had
violated its obligations, assumed not only with regard to Poland
but also with regard to the other signatories of the Paris Pact.
From that moment on, Great Britain and France took cognizance,
in some way, of the launching of an illegal war by Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Recourse to war implies preparation and decision; it would be
futile to prohibit it, if one intended to inflict no chastisement upon
those who knowingly had recourse to it, though they had the power
of choosing a different path. They must, indeed, be considered the
direct instigators of the acts qualified as crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems to us that it is evident from all this that the Charter
of 8 August only established a jurisdiction to judge what was
already an international crime, not only before the conscience of
humanity but also according to international law, even before the
Tribunal was established.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If it is not contested that a crime has really been committed,
is it possible to contest the competence of the International Tribunal
to judge it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There can, indeed, be no doubt that the states bound by the
treaty of 1928 had assumed international responsibilities towards
the co-signatories, should they act contrary to the agreements
undertaken.
<span class='pageno' title='389' id='Page_389'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>International responsibility normally involves the collective
state, as such, without in principle exposing the individuals who
have been the perpetrators of an illegal act. It is within the
framework of the state, with which an international responsibility
rests, that as a general rule the conduct of the men who are
responsible for this violation of international law may be appraised.
They are subject, as the case may be, to political responsibility or
to penal responsibility before the assemblies or the competent
jurisdictions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reason for this is that normally the framework of the state
comprises the nationals: The order of the state assumes the exercise
of justice over a given territory and with regard to the individuals
whom it includes, and the failure of the state in the exercise of
this essential mission is followed by the reaction and the protests
of third powers, notably when their own nationals are involved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in the present situation there is no German State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the Surrender Declaration of 5 May 1945 and until the
day when a government shall have been established by the agreement
of the four occupying Powers, there will be no organ
representing the German State. Under these conditions, it cannot
be considered that a German State juridical order exists, which
is capable of bringing the consequences arising from a recognition
of the responsibility of the Reich for the violation of the Kellogg-Briand
Pact to bear upon those individuals who are, in fact, the
perpetrators of this violation in their capacity as organs of the
Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Today supreme authority is being exercised over the whole
German territory, in regard to the entire German population, by
the Four Powers acting jointly. It must, therefore, be allowed that
the states which exercise supreme authority over the territory and
population of Germany can submit this guilt to a Court’s jurisdiction.
Otherwise, the proclamation that Germany has violated
the solemn covenant which it has undertaken, becomes meaningless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is also involved a penal responsibility incurred for a
series of acts, qualified as crimes, which were committed against
nationals of the United Nations. These acts, which are not juridically
acts of war but which have been committed as such upon the
instigation of those who bear the responsibility for the launching of
the so-called war, who have committed aggression upon the lives and
the property of nationals of the United Nations, may, by virtue of
the territorial principle as we have shown above, be brought before
a jurisdiction constituted for this purpose by the United Nations,
even as war crimes, properly speaking, are now being brought
before the tribunals of each country whose nationals have been
victims hereof.
<span class='pageno' title='390' id='Page_390'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Crimes committed by the Nazis in the course of the war, like the
war of aggression itself, will be, as Mr. Justice Jackson has
demonstrated to you, the manifestation of a concerted and methodically
executed plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These crimes flow directly, like the war itself, from the
National Socialist doctrine. This doctrine is indifferent to the
moral choice of means to attain a final success, and for this
doctrine the aim of war is pillage, destruction, and extermination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Total war, totalitarian war in its methods and its aims, is
dictated by the primacy of the German race and the negation of
any other value. The Nazi conception maintains selection as a
natural principle. The man who does not belong to the superior
race counts for nothing. Human life and even less liberty, personality,
the dignity of man, have no importance when an adversary
of the German community is involved. It is truly “the return to
barbarism” with all its consequences. Logically consistent, National
Socialism goes to the length of assuming the right, either to
exterminate totally races judged hostile or decadent, or to subjugate
or put to use individuals and groups capable of resistance, in the
nations. Does not the idea of totalitarian war imply the annihilation
of any eventual resistance? All those who, in any way, may
be capable of opposing the New Order and the German hegemony
will be liquidated. It will thus become possible to assure an
absolute domination over a neighboring people that has been
reduced to impotence and to utilize, for the benefit of the Reich,
the resources and the human material of those people reduced to
slavery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the moral conceptions which tended to make war more
humane are obviously outdated, and the more so, all international
conventions which had undertaken to bring some extenuation of the
evils of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conquered peoples must concur, willingly or by force, in
the German victory by their material resources, as well as by their
labor potential. Means will be found to subject them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The treatment to which the occupied countries will be subjected
is likewise related to this war aim. One could read in <span class='it'>Deutsche
Volkskraft</span> of 13 June 1935 that the totalitarian war will end in
a totalitarian victory. “Totalitarian” signifies the entire destruction
of the conquered nation and its complete and final disappearance
from the historic scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the conquered peoples distinctions can be made according
to whether or not the National Socialists consider them as belonging
to the Master Race. For the former, an effort is made to integrate
them into the German Reich against their will. For the latter, there
<span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span>
is applied a policy of weakening them and bringing about their
extinction by every means, from that of appropriation of their
property to that of extermination of their persons. In regard to
both groups, the Nazi rulers assault not only the property and
physical persons, but also the spirits and souls. They seek to align
the populations according to the Nazi dogma and behavior, when
they wish to integrate them in the German community; they apply
themselves at least to rooting out whatever conceptions are
irreconcilable with the Nazi universe; they aim to reduce to a
mentality and status of slaves, those men whose nationality they
wish to eradicate for the benefit of the German race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inspired by these general conceptions as to the conduct to be
observed in occupied countries, the defendants gave special orders
or general directives or deliberately identified themselves with
such. Their responsibility is that of perpetrators, co-perpetrators,
or accomplices in the War Crimes systematically committed
between 1 September 1939 and 8 May 1945 by Germany at war.
They deliberately willed, premeditated, and ordered these crimes,
or knowingly associated themselves with this policy of organized
criminality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall expose the various aspects of this policy of criminality
as it was pursued in the occupied countries of Western Europe, by
dealing successively with Forced Labor, Economic Looting, Crimes
against Persons, and Crimes against Mankind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conception of total war, which gave rise to all the crimes
which were to be perpetrated by the Nazi Germans in the occupied
countries, was the basis for the forced labor service. Through this
institution, Germany proposed to utilize to the maximum the labor
potential of the enslaved populations in order to maintain the German
war production at the necessary level. Moreover, there can
be no doubt that this institution was linked with the German
plan of “extermination through labor” of the populations adjoining
Germany which she regarded as dangerous or inferior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A document of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces of
Germany, dated 1 October 1938, provided for the forced employment
of prisoners and civilians for war labor. Hitler in his speech
of 9 November 1941 “did not doubt for a moment that, in the
occupied territories which we control at present, we shall make the
last man work for us.” From 1942 on, it is under the admitted
responsibility of the Defendant Sauckel, acting together with the
Defendant Speer, under the control of the Defendant Göring,
General Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, that obligatory
foreign labor, for the benefit of the war conducted by Germany,
was developed to the full.
<span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The most various methods of constraint were utilized simultaneously
or successively:</p>

<p class='pindent'>First: Requisition of services under conditions incompatible with
Article 52 of the Hague Convention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Second: So-called voluntary labor, which consisted of bringing
a worker under pressure to sign a contract to work in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Third: Conscription for obligatory labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fourth: The forcing of war prisoners to work for the German
war production and their transformation in certain cases into
so-called free workers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifth: The enrolling of certain foreign workers, notably French
(from Alsace or Lorraine) and Luxembourgers in the German
Labor Front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these procedures constitute crimes contrary to international
law and in violation of Article 52 of the Hague Convention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These service requisitions were made under threat of death.
Voluntary labor recruiting was accompanied by individual measures
of constraint, obliging the workers of occupied territories to sign
contracts. The duration of these pseudo-contracts was subsequently
prolonged unilaterally and illegally by the German authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The failure of these measures of requisition or the voluntary
recruitment of labor led the German authorities everywhere to
have recourse to conscription. Hitler declared on 19 August 1942
in a conference on the Four Year Plan, which was reported by the
Defendant Speer, that Germany “had to proceed to forced recruiting
if sufficient labor was not obtained on a voluntary basis.” On
7 November 1943 the Defendant Jodl declared in the course of a
speech given in Munich before the Gauleiter:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In my opinion the time has come to take vigorous, resolute,
and hard measures in Denmark, in Holland, in France, and
in Belgium in order to force thousands of idle men to carry
out this most important work of fortification.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Having accepted the principle of force, the Germans made use
of two complementary methods: Legal constraint, consisting of
promulgating laws regulating obligatory labor; and restraint in
fact, consisting of taking necessary measures to oblige workers
under penalty of grave sanctions to conform to the issued
legislation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The basis of the legislation on forced labor is the decree of
22 August 1942 of the Defendant Sauckel, who formulated the
charter of forced recruiting in all the occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In France, Sauckel got the so-called Government of Vichy to
publish the law of 4 September 1942. This law effected the freezing
of all manpower in industries and anticipated the possibility of a
<span class='pageno' title='393' id='Page_393'></span>
requisition of all Frenchmen who might be employed in any work
useful to the enemy. All Frenchmen from 18 to 50 years of age,
who did not have a job which occupied them more than 30 hours
a week, had to prove that they were usefully employed to meet the
needs of the country. A decree of 19 September 1942 and an
enabling directive of 24 September regulated the various provisions
of this announcement. The law of 4 September 1942 had been
published by the so-called Government of Vichy, following strong
pressure exercised by the occupation authorities. Specifically,
Dr. Michel, Chief of the Administrative Staff of the German
Military Command in France, wrote on 26 August 1942 a threatening
letter to the Delegate General for Franco-German Economic
Relations, requesting him that the law be published.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1943, Sauckel obtained from the <span class='it'>de facto</span> authority a directive
under date of 2 February, stipulating a census of all male Frenchmen
born between 1 January 1912 and 31 December 1921. He also
obtained the passing of the law of 16 February, establishing the
Bureau of Compulsory Labor for all young men from 20 to 22 years
of age. On 9 April 1943, Gauleiter Sauckel requested the deportation
of 120,000 workers for the month of May and another 100,000 for
the month of June. To accomplish this, the so-called Government
of Vichy proceeded to mobilize the entire military conscription
class of 1942. On 15 January 1944 Sauckel requested the <span class='it'>de facto</span>
French authorities to deliver 1 million men for the first 6 months
of the year; and he caused the adoption of the regulation designated
as the law of 1 February 1944, which extended the possibility of
impressing all men from 16 to 60 years of age and women from
the age of 18 to 45 for forced labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Similar measures were taken in all occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Norway, the German authorities imposed on the so-called
Government of Quisling the publication of a law dated 3 February
1943, which established the compulsory registration of Norwegian
citizens and prescribed their forced enrollment. In Belgium and in
Holland, the Bureau of Compulsory Labor was organized directly
by ordinances of the occupying power. In Belgium the ordinances
were promulgated by the military command, and in Holland by the
Defendant Seyss-Inquart, who was Reich Commissar for the
occupied Netherland territories. In both of these countries the
development of a compulsory labor policy followed the same
pattern. Compulsory labor was at first required only within the
occupied territories. It was soon extended in order to permit the
deportation of workers to Germany. This was achieved, in the case
of Holland, by the ordinance of 28 February 1941 and in Belgium
by the ordinance of 6 March 1942 which established the principle
of forced labor. The principle of deportation was formulated in
<span class='pageno' title='394' id='Page_394'></span>
Belgium by means of the ordinance of 6 October 1942, and in
Holland by the ordinance of 23 March 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to ensure the efficiency of these legal provisions, brutal
compulsion was exercised in all countries; numerous round-ups in
all large cities. For example, 50,000 persons were arrested in
Rotterdam on 10 and 11 November 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even more serious than the forced labor of civilian population
was the incorporation of laborers from occupied countries in the
labor service of the Reich. This incorporation was not merely the
conscription of laborers but the application of German legislation
to the nationals of occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the face of the patriotic resistance of the workers of the
different occupied countries, the important results which the
German Labor Office had anticipated were far from being fulfilled.
However, a large number of workers from the occupied countries
were forced to work for the German war effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to the Todt Organization, the laborers who were
employed in the West in the construction of the Atlantic Wall
totalled 248,000 at the end of March 1943. In the year 1942,
3,300,000 workers from occupied countries worked for Germany in
their own country; among others, 300,000 of these were in Norway,
249,000 in Holland, 650,000 in France. The number of workers
deported to Germany and coming from the occupied territories in
the West increased in 1942 to the figure of 131,000 Belgians, 135,000
Frenchmen, 154,000 Hollanders. On 30 April 1943, 1,293,000 workmen,
of whom 269,000 were women, from the occupied territories
in the West were working for the German War Economy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 7 July 1944, Sauckel stated that the number of workers deported
to Germany during these first 6 months of 1944 reached a total of
537,000, of which 33,000 were Frenchmen. On the 1st of March 1944
he acknowledged, during a conference held by the Central Office
of the Four Year Plan, that there were in Germany 5 million foreign
workers, of whom 200,000 were actually volunteers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report of the French Ministry for prisoners, deportees, and
refugees, gives the figure of 715,000 for the total number of men
and women who had been deported.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It should be added that, contrary to international law, the
workers who were transported to Germany had to work under
labor conditions and living conditions that were incompatible with
the most rudimentary regard for human dignity. The Defendant
Sauckel has himself stated that foreign workers, who could achieve
substantial production, should be fed so that they could be exploited
as completely as possible with the minimum of expense, adding that
they should receive less food the moment their production began
<span class='pageno' title='395' id='Page_395'></span>
to decrease and that no concern should be given to the fate of
those whose production capacity no longer presented any interest.
Special reprisal camps were organized for those who sought to
avoid the compulsion imposed on them. An order of 21 December
1942 stipulated that unwilling workers should be sent, without
trial, to such camps. In 1943 Sauckel, during an inter-ministerial
conference, stated that the co-operation of the SS was essential to
him in order to fulfill the task with which he had been entrusted.
Thus, the crime of forced labor and of deportation gave rise to a
whole series of additional crimes against persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work required of war prisoners did not remain within the
legal limits authorized by international law any more than did that
of the civilian laborers. National Socialist Germany obliged
prisoners of war to work for the German war production, in violation
of Articles 31 and 32 of the Geneva Convention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>National Socialist Germany, while exploiting to the fullest
extent for the war effort prisoners as well as workers from occupied
territories against all international conventions, was at the same
time seizing, by every possible means, the wealth of these countries.
German authorities applied systematic pillage in these countries.
By economic pillage we mean both the taking away of goods of
every type and the exploitation, on the spot, of the national
resources for the benefit of Germany’s war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This pillage was methodically organized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans began by making sure that they had in their
possession, in all countries, the necessary means for payment. Thus,
they insured that they could seize, with the appearance of legality,
the wealth which they coveted. After freezing the existing
purchasing power, they required enormous payments under the
pretext of indemnity for the maintenance of occupation troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It should be recalled that, according to the terms of the Hague
Convention, occupied countries may be obliged to assume the burden
of the expenses caused by the maintenance of an army of occupation.
But the amounts that were exacted under this by the
Germans were only remotely related to the actual costs of
occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, they forced the occupied countries to accept a
clearing system which operated practically for the exclusive profit
of Germany. Imports from Germany were almost nonexistent; the
goods exported to Germany by the occupied countries were subject
to no regulation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to maintain for the purchasing balance thus created
a considerable purchasing power, the Germans endeavored everywhere
to achieve the stabilization of prices and imposed a severe
rationing system. This rationing system, which left the population
<span class='pageno' title='396' id='Page_396'></span>
with a quantity of inferior goods which was less than the minimum
indispensable for their existence, afforded the additional advantage
of preserving for the benefit of the Germans the greatest possible
portion of the production.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, the Germans seized a considerable part of the stocks and
of the production as a result of operations which had the appearance
of legality (requisitions, purchases made with German
priority coupons, individual purchase). These transactions were
completed by other operations of a clandestine character, which
were carried out in violation of the official regulations imposed,
frequently by the Germans themselves. Thus, the Germans had
created a whole organization for black market purchases. For
example, one may read in a report of the German Foreign Ministry
of 4 September 1942 that the Defendant Göring had ordered that
purchases on the black market should henceforth extend to goods
which until then had not been included, such as household goods;
and he prescribed further that all goods which could be useful to
Germany should be collected, even if as a result certain signs of
inflation appeared in the occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While they were transporting to Germany the maximum
quantity of goods of every description, after requisitioning without
payment or by paying with bills which they had irregularly
obtained by a simple entry in the clearing account, the Nazi leaders
were at the same time endeavoring to impose the resumption of
activity in industry for the benefit of Germany’s war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>German industrialists had received instructions ordering them
to divide among themselves the enterprises in the occupied areas
which had engaged in a production similar to their own. While
having to carry out these orders, these industrialists were required
to place such industries in occupied countries firmly under their
control by means of different types of financial combinations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The appearance of monetary legality or contractual legality
could in no way hide the fact that economic looting was systematically
organized, contrary to the stipulations of the International
Convention of The Hague. If, according to the stipulations of this
Convention, Germany had the right to seize whatever was
indispensable for the maintenance of the troops necessary for the
occupation, all seizures in excess of these requirements undoubtedly
constitute a war crime, which brought about the economic ruin of
the occupied countries, a long-range weakening of their economic
potential and of their means of subsistence, as well as the general
undernourishment of the populations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Exact estimates of German transactions in the economic field
cannot be formulated at this time. It would be necessary for this
<span class='pageno' title='397' id='Page_397'></span>
purpose to study in detail the activities of several countries over
a period of more than 4 years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless it has been possible to bring out precisely certain
facts and to give minimum estimates of German spoliations with
respect to the different occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Denmark, which was the first country in western Europe to
be invaded, the value of German seizures was nearly 8,000 million
crowns. In Norway, Germany’s spoliations exceed a total value of
20,000 million crowns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Netherlands, German pillage was effected to such an
extent that although Holland is one of the richest countries in the
world in relation to its population, it is today almost completely
ruined and the financial charges imposed by the occupant exceed
20,000 million guilders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Belgium, through various schemes, notably the system of
occupation indemnity and clearing, the Germans seized far more
than 130,000 million Belgian francs of payment balances. The Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg also suffered important losses as a result of
the action of the occupying power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally in France the levying of taxes on means of payments
reached a total of 745,000 million francs. In this sum we have not
included the 74,000 million francs, which represents the maximum
figure which Germany could legally demand for the maintenance
of her army of occupation. (Moreover, the seizure of 9,500 million
in gold was calculated according to the rate of 1939.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to the goods settled for in the occupied countries
by Germany, by means of payment extorted from these countries,
enormous quantities of goods of every character were purely and
simply requisitioned without any indemnity, seized without any
explanation, or else stolen. The occupying authorities not only took
all raw materials and manufactured goods which could be useful
to their war efforts, but they extended their seizures to everything
that might help to procure them a credit balance in neutral countries,
such as movables, jewels, luxury goods, and objects of all
kinds. Finally, the art treasures of the countries of western Europe
were likewise looted in the most shameful manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The considerable sums which Germany was able to obtain by
abusing her power, contrary to all the principles of international law,
without providing any compensation, enabled her to carry out with
the appearance of legality, the economic looting of France and of
the other countries of western Europe. The consequence for these
countries, from the economic viewpoint, is a loss of their strength
which will take long to repair.
<span class='pageno' title='398' id='Page_398'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>But the most serious consequence of these practices affected the
population itself. For more than 4 years the people of the occupied
countries were exposed to a regime of slow starvation, which
resulted in an increase in the death rate, a breaking down of the
physical stamina of the population and, above all, an alarming
deficiency in the growth of children and adolescents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such practices perpetrated and consummated systematically by
the German leaders, contrary to international law and specifically
contrary to the Hague Convention, as well as contrary to the
general principles of criminal law in force in all civilized nations,
constitute War Crimes for which they must answer before Your
High Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would that be a convenient time to break off?</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>M. DE MENTHON: Crimes against the physical person—arbitrary
imprisonment, ill-treatment, deportations, murder committed
by the Germans in the occupied countries—reached proportions
beyond imagination, even in the course of a world conflict, and
took the most odious forms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These crimes spring directly from the Nazi doctrine and testify
to the Reich leaders’ absolute disregard for the human individual,
to the abolition of any sense of justice or even of pity, to a total
subordination of any and all human consideration on the part of
the German community.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these crimes are linked to a policy of terrorism. Such a
policy permits the subjugation of occupied countries without
involving a large deployment of troops and their submission to
anything that might be demanded of them. Many of these crimes
are moreover tied up with the will to exterminate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall examine in succession executions of hostages, police
crimes, deportations, crimes involving prisoners of war, terroristic
activities against the Resistance, and the massacre of civilian
populations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A. The execution of hostages constitutes in all countries the first
act of terrorism on the part of German occupation troops. From
1940 on, the German command, notably in France, carried out
numerous executions as reprisals for any crime against the German
Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These practices, contrary to Article 50 of the Hague Convention
which forbids collective sanctions, awaken everywhere a feeling
of horror and frequently produce a result contrary to the one
sought, by arousing the populations against the occupant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The occupying authorities then endeavored to legalize such
criminal practices, thus seeking to have them recognized by the
populations as “the right” of the occupying power. Veritable
“codes for hostages” were promulgated by the German military
authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following the general order issued by the Defendant Keitel on
16 September 1941, Stülpnagel published in France his ordinance
of 30 September 1941. According to the terms of this ordinance,
all Frenchmen held by German authorities for any reason
whatsoever were to be considered as hostages, as well as all
Frenchmen who were in the custody of the French authorities on
behalf of German organizations. The ordinance of Stülpnagel
specifies:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At the time of the burial of the bodies, burial in a common
grave of a rather large number of persons in a particular
<span class='pageno' title='400' id='Page_400'></span>
cemetery must be avoided, since this would create a shrine
for pilgrims which now or later might become a center for
the stimulation of anti-German propaganda.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In carrying out this ordinance the most infamous executions of
hostages were committed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following the murder of two German officers, one in Nantes on
2 October 1941 and the other at Bordeaux a few days thereafter,
the German authorities had 27 hostages shot at Châteaubriant and
21 at Nantes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 15 August 1942, 96 hostages were shot at Mon-Valérien.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In September 1942 an assault had been committed against
German soldiers in the Rex motion picture house in Paris. One
hundred sixteen hostages were shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forty-six hostages were taken from the hostage depot of the
Fortress at Romainville and 70 from Bordeaux.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In reprisal for the murder of a German official of the labor
front 50 hostages were shot in Paris at the end of September 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Threats of reprisals on the families of the patriots of the
Resistance are related to the same odious policy of hostages. The
Kommandantur published the following notice in the <span class='it'>Pariser
Zeitung</span> of 16 July 1942:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Near male relatives, brothers-in-law, and cousins of the
‘agitators’ above the age of 18 years will be shot.</p>
<hr class='tbk432'/>
<p class='noindent'>“All female family members of the same degree of relationship
shall be condemned to forced labor.</p>
<hr class='tbk433'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Children less than 18 years of age of all above-mentioned
persons shall be sent to a house of correction.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The executions of hostages continued everywhere until the
liberation, but in the last period they were no more than one
additional feature in the methods of German terrorism, then grown
more sweeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>B. Among the crimes against persons of which the civilian
populations of the occupied countries of the West were victims,
those committed by the Nazi police organizations are the most
revolting. The intervention of the German police who, in spite of
certain appearances, did not belong to the armies of occupation, is
in itself contrary to international law. Their crimes, particularly
hateful in the complete disregard for human dignity that they
imply, were multiplied during 4 years throughout all the territories
of the West occupied by the German forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>True, no definite order, no detailed directive emanating directly
from one of the defendants or from one of their immediate subordinates
and valid for all the German police or for the police
of the occupied territories of the West, has been found. But these
<span class='pageno' title='401' id='Page_401'></span>
crimes were committed by a police that was a direct expression
of the National Socialist ideology and the undeniable instrument
of National Socialist policy for which all the defendants carry the
full and entire responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the considerable mass of acts, their similarity, their
simultaneousness, their generalization in time and place, no one
would be able to deny that these acts are not only the individual
responsibility of those who committed them here or there, but
constitute as well the execution of orders from above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The arrests took place without any of the elementary guarantees
recognized in all civilized countries. On a simple, unverified
denunciation, without previous investigation, and often on charges
brought by persons not qualified to bring them, masses of arbitrary
arrests took place in every occupied country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the first period of the occupation, the Germans nevertheless
simulated a scrupulous respect for “legality” in the matter of
arrests. This legality was that introduced by Nazism in the interior
of Germany and did not respect any of the traditional guarantees
to which the individuals in civilized countries are entitled. But,
rapidly, even this pseudo-legality itself was abandoned and the
arrests became absolutely arbitrary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The worst treatments were applied to arrested persons even
before the guilt of the accused had been examined. The use of
torture in the interrogations was almost a general rule. The
tortures usually applied were beating, whipping, chaining for
several days without a moment of rest for nourishment or hygienic
care, immersion in ice water, drowning in a bathtub, charging the
bathwater with electricity, electrification of the most sensitive parts
of the body, burns at certain places on the body, and the pulling
out of fingernails. But, in addition, those who carried out these
measures had every latitude for unleashing their instinct of cruelty
and of sadism towards their victims. All those facts, which were of
public knowledge in the occupied countries, never led to any
punishment whatsoever of their authors on the part of the
responsible authorities. It even seems that the torture was more
severe when an officer was present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is undeniable that the actions of the German police towards
the prisoners were part and parcel of a long premeditated system
of criminality, ordered by the chiefs of the regime and executed
by the most faithful members of the National Socialist organizations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aside from the general use of torture on prisoners, the German
police perpetrated a considerable number of murders. It is impossible
to know the conditions under which many of these murders
were carried out. Nevertheless, we have enough information to
permit us to discover in them a new expression of the general
<span class='pageno' title='402' id='Page_402'></span>
policy of the National Socialists in the occupied countries. Often the
deaths were only the result of the tortures inflicted on the prisoners,
but often the murder was deliberately desired and carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>C. The crime which will undoubtedly be remembered as the
most horrible among those committed by the Germans against the
civilian populations of the occupied countries was that of deportation
and internment in the concentration camps of Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These deportations had a double aim: To secure additional labor
for the benefit of the German war machine; to eliminate from the
occupied countries and progressively exterminate the elements most
opposed to Germanism. They served likewise to empty prisons
overcrowded with patriots and to remove the latter for all time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The deportations and the methods employed in the concentration
camps were a stupefying revelation for the civilized world.
Nevertheless, they also are only a natural consequence of the
National Socialist doctrine, according to which man, of himself,
has no value except when he is of service to the German race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not possible to give exact figures. It is probable that one
would make an understatement when speaking of 250,000 for
France; 6,000 for Luxembourg; 5,200 for Denmark; 5,400 for Norway;
120,000 for Holland; and 37,000 for Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The arrests are founded, now under a pretext of a political
nature, now on a pretext of a racial nature. In the beginning they
were individual; subsequently they took on a collective character,
particularly in France since the end of 1941. Sometimes the deportation
did not come until after long months of prison, but more
often the arrest was made directly with a view to deportation under
the system of “protective custody.” Everywhere imprisonment in
the country of origin was accompanied by brutality, often by
tortures. Before being sent to Germany, the deportees were, in
general, concentrated in an assembly camp. The formation of a
convoy was often the first stage of extermination. The deportees
travelled in cattle cars, 80 to 120 per car, no matter what the
season. There were few convoys where no deaths occurred. In
certain transports the proportion of deaths was more than 25 percent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The deportees were sent to Germany, almost always to concentration
camps, but sometimes also to prisons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Admitted to the prisons were those deportees who had been
condemned or were awaiting trial. The prisoners there were
crowded together under inhumane conditions. Nevertheless, the
prison regime was generally less severe than conditions in the
camps. The work there was less out of proportion to the strength
of the prisoners, and the prison wardens were more humane than
the SS in the concentration camps.
<span class='pageno' title='403' id='Page_403'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It appears to have been the plan, followed by the Nazis in the
concentration camps, gradually to do away with the prisoners; but
only after their working strength had been used to the advantage
of the German war effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal has been told of the almost inconceivable treatment
inflicted by the SS on the prisoners. We shall take the liberty
of going into still further detail during the course of the statement
of the French Prosecution, for it must be fully known to what
extent of horrors the Germans, inspired by National Socialist
doctrine, could stoop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most terrible aspect was perhaps the desire to create moral
degradation and debasement in the prisoner until he lost, if
possible, all semblance of a human individual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The usual living conditions imposed on the deportees in the
camps were sufficient to ensure slow extermination through inadequate
feeding, bad sanitation, cruelty of the guards, severity of
discipline, strain of work out of proportion to the strength of the
prisoner, and haphazard medical service. Moreover, you already
know that many did not die a natural death, but were put to death
by injections, gas chambers, or inoculations of fatal diseases. But
more speedy extermination was often the case; it was often brought
about by ill-treatment: communal ice-cold showers in winter in
the open air, prisoners left naked in the snow, cudgelling, dog
bites, hanging by the wrists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some figures will illustrate the result of these various methods
of extermination. At Buchenwald, during the first 3 months of 1945,
there were 13,000 deaths out of 40,000 internees. At Dachau, 13,000
to 15,000 died in the 3 months preceding the liberation. At Auschwitz,
a camp of systematic extermination, the number of murdered
persons came to several millions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the total number of those deported from France, the
official figure is as follows: Of 250,000 deported only 35,000
returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The deportees served as guinea pigs for numerous medical,
surgical, or other experiments which generally led to their death.
At Auschwitz, at Struthof, in the prison at Cologne, at Ravensbrück,
at Neuengamme, numerous men, women, and children were
sterilized. At Auschwitz the most beautiful women were set apart,
artificially fertilized, and then gassed. At Struthof a special
barrack, isolated from the others by barbed wire, was used to
inoculate men in groups of 40 with fatal illnesses. In the same
camp women were gassed while German doctors observed their
reactions through a peephole arranged for this purpose. Extermination
was often directly effected by means of individual or collective
<span class='pageno' title='404' id='Page_404'></span>
executions. These were carried out by shooting, by hanging, by
injections, by gas vans, or gas chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should not wish to stress further the facts, already so
numerous, submitted to Your High Tribunal during the preceding
days by the American Prosecution, but the representative of France,
so many of his people having died in these camps after horrible
sufferings, could not pass in silence over this tragic example of
complete inhumanity. This would have been inconceivable in the
20th century, if a doctrine of return to barbarism had not been
established in the very heart of Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>D. Crimes committed against prisoners of war, although less
known, bear ample testimony to the degree of inhumanity which
Nazi Germany had attained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To begin with, the violations of international conventions committed
against prisoners of war are numerous. Many were forced
to travel on foot, almost without food, for very long distances.
Many camps had no respect for even the most elementary rules of
hygiene. Food was very often insufficient; thus a report from the
WFSt of the OKW dated 11 April 1945 and annotated by the
Defendant Keitel, shows that 82,000 prisoners of war interned in
Norway received the food strictly indispensable to the maintenance
of life on the assumption that they were not working, whereas
30,000 of them were really employed on heavy work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In agreement with the Defendant Keitel, acting at the request
of the Defendant Göring, camps for prisoners belonging to the
British and American Air Forces were established in towns which
were exposed to air raids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In violation of the text of the Geneva Convention, it was
decided, at a conference held at the Führer’s headquarters on
27 January 1945, in the presence of the Defendant Göring, to
punish by death all attempts to escape made by prisoners of war
when in convoy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides all these violations of the Geneva Convention, numerous
crimes were committed by the German authorities against prisoners
of war: Execution of captured allied airmen, murder of
commando troops, collective extermination of certain prisoners of
war for no reason whatsoever—for example the matter of 120
American soldiers at Malmédy on 27 January 1945. Parallel with
“Nacht und Nebel,” an expression for the inhumane treatment
inflicted on civilians, can be put down the “Sonderbehandlung,” a
“special treatment” of prisoners of war, in which these disappeared
in great numbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>E. The same barbarism is found in the terroristic activity carried
out by the German Army and Police against the Resistance.
<span class='pageno' title='405' id='Page_405'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The order of the Defendant Keitel of 16 September 1941, which
may be considered as a basic document, certainly has as a purpose
the fight against the Communist movements; but it anticipates that
resistance to the army of occupation can come from other than
Communist sources and decides that every case of resistance is to
be interpreted as having a Communist origin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, in carrying out this general order to
annihilate the Resistance by every possible means, the Germans
arrested, tortured, and massacred men of all ranks and all classes.
To be sure, the members of the Resistance rarely complied with
the conditions laid down by the Hague Conventions, which would
qualify them to be considered as regular combat forces; they could
be sentenced to death as <span class='it'>francs-tireurs</span> and executed. But they
were assassinated without trial in most cases, often after having
been terribly tortured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the liberation, numerous charnel-houses were discovered
and the bodies examined by doctors: They bore obvious traces of
extreme brutal treatment, cranial tissue was pulled out, the spinal
column had been dislocated, the ribs had been so badly fractured
that the chest had been entirely crushed and the lungs perforated,
hair and nails had been pulled out. It is impossible to determine
the total number of the victims of German atrocities in the fight
against the Resistance. It is certainly very high. In the department
of the Rhône alone, for example, the bodies of 713 victims were
discovered after the liberation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An order of 3 February 1944 of the Commander-in-Chief of the
forces in the West, signed “By order General Sperrle,” laid down
for the fight against the terrorists immediate reply by fire-arms
and the immediate burning down of all houses from which shots
had come:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is of little importance”—the text adds—“that innocent
people should suffer. It will be the fault of the terrorists. All
commanders of troops who show weakness in repressing the
terrorists will be severely punished. On the other hand, those
who go beyond the orders received and are too severe will
incur no penalty.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The war diary of Von Brodowski, commanding Liaison Headquarters
Number 588, at Clermont-Ferrand, gives irrefutable
examples of the barbarous forms which the Germans gave to the
struggle against the Resistance. The resisters caught were almost
all shot on the spot. Others were turned over to the SD or the
Gestapo to be subjected first to torture. The diary of Brodowski
mentions “the cleaning up of a hospital” or “liquidation of an
infirmary.”
<span class='pageno' title='406' id='Page_406'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The struggle against the Resistance had the same atrocious
character in all the occupied territories of the West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>F. The last months of the German occupation were characterized
in France by a strengthening of the policy of terrorism which
multiplied the crimes against the civilian population. The crimes
which we are going to consider were not isolated acts committed
from time to time in this or that locality, but were acts perpetrated
in the course of extensive operations, the high number of which
can be explained only by general orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The perpetrators of these crimes were frequently members of
the SS, but the military command shares responsibility for them.
In a directive entitled “Fight against the Partisan Bands,” dated
6 May 1944, the Defendant Jodl states that:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the collective measures to be taken against the inhabitants
of entire villages (including the burning down of these
villages) are to be ordered exclusively by the division
commanders or the heads of the SS and of the police.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The war diary of Von Brodowski mentions the following: “It is
understood that the leadership of the Sipo and of the SD shall be
subordinate to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These operations are supposedly measures of reprisal which
were caused by the action of the Resistance. But the necessities of
war have never justified the plundering and heedless burning
down of towns and villages nor the blind massacres of innocent
people. The Germans killed, plundered, burned down, very often
without any reason whatsoever, whether in Ain, in Savoie, Lot,
or Tarn-and-Garonne, in Vercors, Corréze, in Dordogne. Entire
villages were burned down at a time when the nearest armed
groups of the Resistance were tens of kilometers away and the
population of these villages had not made a single hostile gesture
towards the German troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two most typical examples are those of Maillé (in Indre-et-Loire)
where on 25 August 1944, 52 buildings out of 60 were
destroyed and 124 people were killed; and that of Oradour-sur-Glane
(in the Haute-Vienne). The war diary of Von Brodowski
makes mention of the latter act in the following manner:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“All the male population of Oradour was shot. The women
and children took refuge in the church. The church caught
fire. Explosives were stored in the church. (This assertion has
been shown to be false.) Also women and children perished.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the scale of criminal undertakings, perpetrated in the course
of the war by the leaders of National Socialist Germany, we
finally meet a category which we have called crimes against human
status (<span class='it'>la condition humaine</span>).
<span class='pageno' title='407' id='Page_407'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>First of all it is important that I should define clearly for the
Tribunal the meaning of this term. This classical French expression
belongs both to the technical vocabulary of law and to the language
of philosophy. It signifies all those faculties, the exercising and
developing of which rightly constitute the meaning of human life.
Each of these faculties finds its corresponding expression in the
order of man’s existence in society. His belonging to at least two
social groups—the nearest and the most extensive—is translated
by the right to family life and to nationality. His relations with
the powers constitute a system of obligations and guarantees. His
material life, as producer and consumer of goods, is expressed by
the right to work in the widest meaning of this term. Its spiritual
aspect implies a combination of possibilities to give out and to
receive the expressions of thought, whether in assemblies or associations,
in religious practice, in teachings given or received, by
the many means which progress has put at the disposal for the
dissemination of intellectual value: Books, press, radio, cinema. This
is the right of spiritual liberty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Against this human status, against the status of public and civil
rights of the human beings in occupied territories, the German
Nazis directed a systematic policy of corruption and demoralization.
We shall treat this question last because it is this undertaking
which presents a character of the utmost gravity and which has
assumed the most widespread prevalence. Man is more attached
to his physical integrity and to life than to his property. But in
all high conceptions of life, man is even less attached to life than
to that which makes for his dignity and quality, according to the
great Latin maxim, “<span class='it'>Et propter vitam, vivendi perdere causas</span>.”
On the other hand, if, in the territories occupied by them, the
Germans did not, in spite of the importance and extent of their
crimes, plunder all the property and goods and if they did not kill
all the people, there remains not a single man whose essential
rights they did not change or abolish and whose condition as a
human being they did not violate in some way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We can even say that in the entire world and as regards all
people, even those to whom they reserved the privileges belonging
to the superior race and even as regards themselves, their agents,
and accomplices, the Nazi leaders committed a major offense against
the conscience which mankind has today evolved from his status
as a human being. The execution of the enterprise was preceded
by its plan. This is manifest in the entire Nazi doctrine and we
shall content ourselves by recalling a few of its dominant features.
The human status expresses itself, we say, in major statutes, every
one of which comprises a complex apparatus of very different
provisions. But these statutes are inspired in the laws of civilized
<span class='pageno' title='408' id='Page_408'></span>
countries by a conception essential to the nature of man. This
conception is defined in two complementary ideas: The dignity of
the human being considered in each and every person individually,
on the one hand; and on the other hand, the permanence of the
human being considered within the whole of humanity. Every
juridical organization of the human being in a state of civilization
proceeds from this essential, two-fold conception of the individual,
in each and in all, the individual and the universal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without doubt, to Occidentals this conception usually appears
connected with the Christian doctrine; but, if it is exact that
Christianity is bound up with its affirmation and diffusion, it would
be a mistake to see in it only the teachings of one or even of
certain religions. It is a general conception which imposes itself
quite naturally on the spirit; It was professed since ancient pre-Christian
times; and, in more recent times, the great German
philosopher Kant expressed it in one of his most forceful formulas,
by saying that a human being should always be considered as an
end and never a means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The role, as we have already exposed, of the zealots of the
Hitlerian myth was to protest against the spontaneous affirmation
of the genius of mankind and to pretend to break at this point the
continuous progress of moral intelligence. The Tribunal is already
acquainted with the abundant literature of this sect. Without a
doubt, nobody expressed himself more clearly than the Defendant
Rosenberg when he declared in the <span class='it'>Myth of the 20th Century</span>,
Page 539:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Peoples whose health is dependent on their blood do not
know individualism as a criterion of values any more than
they recognize universalism. Individualism and universalism
in the absolute sense and historically speaking, are the
ideological concepts of decadence.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Nazism professes, moreover, that:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The distance between the lowest human being still worthy
of this name, and our higher races, is greater than that
between the lowest type of mankind and the best educated
monkey.” (<span class='it'>Die Reden Hitlers</span>, Reichsparteitag 1933, Page 33).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, it is not only a question of abolishing the truly divine
conception which religion sets forth as regards man, but even of
setting aside all purely human conceptions and substituting for it
an animalistic conception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a consequence of such a doctrine, the upsetting of the human
status appears not only to be a means to which one has recourse
in the presence of temporary opportunities, such as those arising
from war, but also as an aim both necessary and desirable. The
<span class='pageno' title='409' id='Page_409'></span>
Nazis propose to classify mankind in three main categories: That
of their adversaries, or persons whom they consider inadaptable to
their peculiar constructions—this category can be bullied in all
sorts of ways and even destroyed; that of superior men which they
claim is distinguishable by their blood or by some arbitrary
means; that of inferior men, who do not deserve destruction and
whose vital power should be used in a regime of slavery for the
well-being of the “overlords.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi leaders proposed to apply this conception everywhere
they could in territories more and more extended, to populations
ever more numerous; and in addition they demonstrated the frightful
ambition to succeed in imposing it on intelligent people, to
convince their victims and to demand from them, in addition to
so many sacrifices, an act of faith. The Nazi war is a war of
fanatic religion in which one can exterminate infidels and equally
as well impose conversion upon them. It should further be noted
that the Nazis aggravated the excesses of those horrible times, for
in a religious war converted adversaries were received like brothers,
whereas the Nazis never gave their pitiable victims the chance of
saving themselves, even by the most complete recantation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is by virtue of these conceptions that the Germans undertook
the Germanization of occupied territories and had, without doubt,
the intention of undertaking to germanize the whole world. This
Germanization can be distinguished from the ancient theories of
Pan-Germanism insofar as it is both a Nazification and an actual
return to barbarism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Racialism classifies occupied nations into two main categories;
Germanization means for some a National Socialist assimilation,
and for others disappearance or slavery. For human beings of the
so-called “higher race,” the favored condition assigned to them
comprises the falling-in with the new concepts of the Germanic
community. For human beings of the so-called “inferior race” it
was proposed either to abolish all rights while waiting or preparing
their physical destruction, or to assign them to servitude. For both,
racialism means acceptance of the Nazi myths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This two-fold program of absolute Germanization was not carried
out in its entirety nor in all the occupied countries. The Germans
had conceived it as a lengthy piece of work which they intended
to carry out gradually, by a series of successive measures. This
progressive approach is always characteristic of the Nazi method.
It fits in, apparently, with the variety of obstacles encountered,
with the hypocritical desire of sparing public opinion, and with
a horrid lust for experimenting and scientific ostentation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the countries were liberated, the state of the Germanization
varied a great deal according to the different countries, and
<span class='pageno' title='410' id='Page_410'></span>
in each country according to such and such category of the
population. At times the method was driven on to its extreme
consequences; elsewhere, one only discovers signs of preparatory
arrangements. But it is easy to note everywhere the trend of the
same evil, interrupted at different moments in its development,
but everywhere directed by the same inexorable movement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards national status, the Germans proceeded to an
annexation, pure and simple, in Luxembourg, in the Belgian cantons
of Eupen and of Malmédy, and in the French departments of Alsace
and of Lorraine. Here the criminal undertaking consisted both in
the abolition of the sovereignty of the state, natural protector of
its nationals, and in the abolition for those nationals of the status
they had as citizens of this state, a status recognized by domestic
and international law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The inhabitants of these territories thereby lost their original
nationality, ceasing to be Luxembourgers, Belgians, or French. They
did not acquire, however, full German nationality; they were
admitted only gradually to this singular favor, on the further condition
that they furnish certain justifications therefor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans sought to efface in them even the memory of their
former country. In Alsace and in Moselle the French language was
banned; names of places and of people were germanized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>New citizens or mere subjects were equally subjected to the
obligations relating to the Nazi regime: To forced labor, as a matter
of course, and soon to military conscription. In case of resistance
to these unjust and abominable orders, since it was a matter of
arming the French against their allies and in reality against their
own country, sanctions were brought to bear, not only against the
parties concerned, but even against the members of their families,
following the theses of Nazi law, which brush aside the fundamental
principles of law against repression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Persons who appeared recalcitrant to Nazification, or even those
who seemed of little use to Nazi enterprises, became victims of
large-scale expulsions, driven from their homes in a few short
hours with their most scanty baggage, and despoiled of their
property.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet this inhuman evacuation of entire populations, which will
remain one of the horrors of our century, appears as favorable
treatment when compared to the deportations which were to fill
the concentration camps, in particular the Struthof Camp in Alsace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same time that they oppressed the population by force
and in contravention of all law, the Nazis undertook, according to
their method, to convince the people of the excellence of their
<span class='pageno' title='411' id='Page_411'></span>
regime. The young people especially were to be educated in the
spirit of National Socialism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans did not proceed to the annexation, properly
speaking, of other areas than those we have named. It is beyond
doubt, however, and confirmed by numerous indications, that they
proposed to annex territories much more important by applying to
them the same regime, if the war had ended in a German victory.
But everywhere they prepared for the abolition or the weakening
of the national status by debarring or damaging the sovereignty
of the state involved and by forcing the destruction of patriotic
feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all the occupied countries, whether or not there existed an
apparent governmental authority, the Germans systematically disregarded
the laws of occupation. They legislated, regulated,
administered. Besides the territories annexed outright, the other
occupied territories also were in a state that might be defined as
a state of pre-annexation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This leads to a second aspect which is the attack on spiritual
security. Everywhere, although with variation in time and space,
the Germans applied themselves to abolishing the public freedoms,
notably the freedom of association, the freedom of the press; and
they endeavored to trammel the essential freedoms of the spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German authorities subordinated the press to the strictest
censorship, even in matters devoid of military character; a press,
many of whose representatives, moreover, were inspired by them.
Manifold restrictions were imposed on industry and on the moving
picture business. Numerous works altogether without political
character were banned, even textbooks. Religious authorities themselves
saw their clerical realm invaded and words of truth could
not be heard. After having curtailed freedom of expression even
beyond the degree that a state of war and occupation justified, the
Germans developed their National Socialist propaganda systematically
through the press, radio, films, meetings, books, and posters.
All these efforts achieved so little result that one might attempt
today to minimize their importance. Nevertheless, the propaganda
conducted by means most contrary to the respect due human
intelligence and on behalf of a criminal doctrine, must go down in
history as one of the disgraces of the National Socialist regime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No less did the Germanization program compromise human
rights in the other broad aspects that we have defined: Right of the
family, right of professional and economic activity, juridical
guarantees. These rights were attacked; these guarantees were
curtailed. The forced labor and the deportations infringed the
rights of the family, as well as the rights of labor. The arbitrary
<span class='pageno' title='412' id='Page_412'></span>
arrests suppressed the most elementary legal guarantees. In addition,
the Germans tried to impose their own methods on the administrative
authorities of the occupied countries and sometimes unfortunately
succeeded in their attempts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is also known that racial discriminations were provoked
against citizens of the occupied countries who were catalogued as
Jews, measures particularly hateful, damaging to their personal
rights and to their human dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these criminal acts were committed in violation of the rules
of international law, and in particular the Hague Convention,
which limits the rights of armies occupying a territory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fight of the Nazis against the human status completes the
tragic and monstrous totality of war criminality of Nazi Germany,
by placing her under the banner of the abasement of man, deliberately
brought about by the National Socialist doctrine. This gives
it its true character of a systematic undertaking of a return to
barbarism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such are the crimes which National Socialist Germany committed
while waging the war of aggression that she launched. The
martyred peoples appeal to the justice of civilized nations and
request Your High Tribunal to condemn the National Socialist Reich
in the person of its surviving chiefs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let the defendants not be astonished at the charges brought
against them and let them not dispute at all this principle of retroactivity,
the permanence of which was guaranteed, against their
wishes, by democratic legislation. War Crimes are defined by international
law and by the national law of all modern civilizations.
The defendants knew that acts of violence against the persons and
property and human status of enemy nationals were crimes for
which they would have to answer before international justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Governments of the United Nations have addressed many
a warning to them since the beginning of the hostilities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 25 October 1941 Franklin Roosevelt, President of the United
States of America, and Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of Great
Britain, announced that the war criminals would not escape just
punishment:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The massacres of France”—said Churchill—“are an example
of what Hitler’s Nazis are doing in many other countries
under their yoke. The atrocities committed in Poland, Yugoslavia,
Norway, Holland, Belgium, and particularly behind
the German front in Russia, exceed anything that has been
known since the darkest and most bestial ages of humanity.
The punishment of these crimes should now be counted
among the major goals of the war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='413' id='Page_413'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>During autumn 1941 the representatives of the governments of
the occupied countries met in London upon the initiative of the
Polish and Czech Governments. They worked out an inter-Allied
declaration which was signed on 13 January 1942. May I remind
the Tribunal of its terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The undersigned, representing the Governments of Belgium,
of Czechoslovakia, the National Committee of Free France,
the Governments of Greece, of Luxembourg, of the Netherlands,
of Poland, and of Yugoslavia,</p>
<hr class='tbk434'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Whereas Germany, from the beginning of the present conflict,
which was provoked by her policy of aggression, set up
in the occupied countries a regime of terror characterized,
among other things, by imprisonment, mass expulsions,
massacres, and execution of hostages;</p>
<hr class='tbk435'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Whereas these acts of violence are committed equally by
the allies and associates of the Reich, and in certain countries
by citizens collaborating with the occupying power;</p>
<hr class='tbk436'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Whereas international solidarity is necessary in order to
prevent these deeds of violence from giving rise to acts of
individual or collective violence, and finally in order to
satisfy the spirit of justice in the civilized world;</p>
<hr class='tbk437'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Recalling to mind that international law and, in particular,
the Hague Convention signed in 1907, concerning the laws
and customs of land warfare, do not permit belligerents to
commit acts of violence against civilians in occupied countries,
or to violate laws which are in force or to overthrow national
institutions;</p>
<hr class='tbk438'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. Affirming that acts of violence thus committed against

<p class='pindent'>The leaders of National Socialist Germany received other warnings.
I refer to the speech of General De Gaulle of 13 January 1942;
that of Churchill of 8 September 1942; the note of Molotov, Commissar
of the People for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, of
14 October 1942; and the second inter-Allied declaration of
17 December 1942. The latter was made simultaneously in London,
Moscow, and Washington after receipt of information according to
which the German authorities were engaged in exterminating the
Jewish minorities in Europe. In this declaration, the Governments
of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Norway, Poland, the United States of America, the United Kingdom,
the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and the French National
Committee which represented the continuation of France, solemnly
reaffirmed their will to punish the war criminals who are responsible
for this extermination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would this be a convenient time to break
off for 10 minutes?</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>M. DE MENTHON: The premises for a just punishment are thus
fulfilled. The defendants, at the time when they committed their
crimes, knew the will of the United Nations to bring about their
punishment. The warnings which were given to them contain a
definition which precedes the punishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defendants, moreover, could not be ignorant of the criminal
nature of their activities. The warnings of these Allied governments
in effect translated in a political form the fundamental principles
of international and of national law which permit the punishment
of war criminals to be established on positive precedents and positive
rules.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The founders of international law had a presentiment of the
concept of war crime, particularly Grotius who elucidated the
criminal character of needless acts of war. The Hague Conventions,
after the lapse of several centuries, established the first generally
binding standards for laws of war. They regulated the conduct of
hostilities and occupation procedures; they formulated positive
rules in order to limit recourse to force and to bring the necessities
of war into agreement with the requirements of human conscience.
War Crimes thus received the first definition under which they
may be considered; they became a violation of laws and customs
of war as codified by the Hague Convention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the war of 1914. Imperial Germany waged the first
World War with a brutality perhaps less systematic and frenzied
than that of the National Socialist Reich, but just as deliberate.
The deportation of workers, looting of public and private property,
the taking and killing of hostages, the demoralization of the
<span class='pageno' title='415' id='Page_415'></span>
occupied territories constituted, in 1914 as in 1939, the political
methods of German warfare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Treaty of Versailles was based on the Hague Convention
in order to establish the suppression of War Crimes. Under the
title “Sanctions” Chapter VII of the Treaty of Versailles discusses
criminal responsibility incurred in the launching and waging of the
conflict which was then the Great War. Article 227 accused William
of Hohenzollern, previously Emperor of Germany, of a
supreme offense against international morality and against the
sacred character of treaties. Article 228 acknowledged the right of
the Allied and Associated Powers to bring persons guilty of acts
contrary to the laws and customs of war before military tribunals.
Article 229 provided that criminals whose acts were not of precise
geographical location were to be referred to inter-Allied jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The provisions of the Treaty of Versailles were repeated in the
conventions which were signed in 1919 and 1920 with the powers
allied with Germany, in particular in the Treaty of Saint-Germain
and in that of Neuilly. That is how the idea of war crime was
affirmed in international law. The peace treaties of 1919 not only
defined the concept of infraction, they formulated the terms of its
repression. The defendants were aware of this, just as they were
aware of the warnings of the governments of the United Nations.
They no doubt hoped that the repetition of the factual circumstances,
which hampered the punishment of the criminals in 1914,
would permit them to escape their just punishment. Their presence
before this Tribunal is the symbol of the constant progress which
international law is making in spite of all obstacles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>International law had given a still more precise definition of
the term “war crime.” This definition was formulated by the commission
which the preliminary peace conference appointed on
25 January 1919 to disentangle the various responsibilities incurred
in the course of the war. The report of the Commission of Fifteen
of 29 March 1919 constitutes the historical basis of Articles 227 and
following of the Treaty of Versailles. The Commission of Fifteen
based its investigation of criminal responsibilities on an analysis of
the crimes liable to involve them. A material element enters into
the juridical settlement of any infraction. Its definition is, therefore,
the more precise as it includes an enumeration of the facts
which it encompasses. That is why the Commission of Fifteen set
up a list of War Crimes. This list includes 32 infractions. These
are particularly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. Murders, massacres, systematic terrorism; 2. killing of
hostages; 3. torture of civilians; 8. confinement of civilians in inhuman
conditions; 9. forced labor of civilians in connection with
<span class='pageno' title='416' id='Page_416'></span>
military operations of the enemy; 10. usurpation of sovereignty
during the occupation of occupied territories; 11. forced conscription
of soldiers among the inhabitants of the occupied territories;
12. attempts to denationalize the inhabitants of occupied territories;
13. looting; 14. confiscation of property; 17. imposition of
collective fines; 18. wilful devastation and destruction of property;
25. violation of other rules concerning the Red Cross; 29. ill-treatment
of wounded and prisoners of war; and 30. use of prisoners of
war for unauthorized work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This list, which already includes the grievances against the
defendants enumerated in the Indictment and from which we have
just quoted a few facts, is significant because the War Crimes
which it encompasses all present a composite character. They are
crimes against both international law and national law. Some of
these crimes constitute attacks on the fundamental liberties and
constitutional rights of peoples and of individuals; they consist in
the violation of public guarantees which are recognized by the constitutional
Charter of the Nations whose territories were occupied;
violation of the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity which
France proclaimed in 1789 and which the civilized states
guarantee in perpetuity. These War Crimes are violations of public
international law, since they represent a systematic refusal of
acknowledgment of all respective rights of both occupying and
occupied power; but they also may be analyzed as violations of
public national law, since they mean forcibly transforming the constitutional
institutions of the occupied territories and the juridical
statute of their inhabitants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More numerous are crimes which constitute attacks on the
integrity of the physical person and of property. They are allied
with war law regulations and include violations of international
law and customs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the international conventions, it should be noticed, determine
the elements constituting an infraction more than they
actually establish that infraction itself. The latter existed before
in all national legislatures; it was to some extent a part of the
juridical inheritance common to all nations; governments agreed to
affirm its international character and to define its contents. International
penal law is thus superimposed on national law, which
preserves its repressive basis because the war crime remains, after
all, a crime of common law. National penal law gives the definition
of this. All the acts referred to in Article 6 of the Charter
of 8 August 1945, all the facts encompassed by the third Count of
the Indictment of 18 October 1945 correspond to the infractions of
common law provided for and punished by national penal legislation.
The killing of prisoners of war, of hostages, and of inhabitants
<span class='pageno' title='417' id='Page_417'></span>
of occupied territories falls, in French law, under Articles 295
and following of the Penal Code, which define murder and
assassination. The mistreatment to which the Indictment refers
would come under the heading of bodily injuries caused intentionally
or through negligence which are defined by Articles 309 and
following. Deportation is analyzed, independently of the murders
which accompany it, as arbitrary sequestration, which is defined by
Articles 341 and 344. Pillage of public and private property and
imposition of collective fines are penalized by Articles 221 and the
following of our Military Code of Justice. Article 434 of the Penal
Code punishes voluntary destruction, and the deportation of
civilian workers may be compared with the forced conscription
provided for by Article 92. The oath of allegiance is equivalent to
the exaction of a false oath in Article 366, and the Germanization
of occupied territories may be applied to a number of crimes, the
most obvious of which is forced incorporation in the Wehrmacht
in violation of Article 92. The same equivalents can be found in
all modern legislative systems and particularly in German law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crimes against persons and property of which the defendants
are guilty are provided for by all national laws. They present
an international character because they were committed in several
different countries; from this there arises a problem of jurisdiction,
which the Charter of 8 August 1945 has solved, as we have previously
explained; but this leaves intact the rule of definition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A crime of common law, the war crime is, nevertheless, not an
ordinary infraction. It has a character peculiarly intrinsic—it is a
crime committed on the occasion or under the pretext of war. It
must be punished because, even in time of war, attacks on the
integrity of the physical person and or property are crimes if they
are not justified by the laws and customs of war. The soldier
who on the battlefield kills an enemy combatant commits a crime,
but this crime is justified by the law of war. International law
therefore intervenes in the definition of a war crime, not in order
to give it essential qualification but in order to fix its outer limits.
In other words, every infraction committed on the occasion or
under the pretext of hostilities is criminal unless justified by the
laws and customs of war. International law here applies the
national theory of legitimate defense which is common to all codes
of criminal law. The combatant is engaged in legitimate defense
on the battlefield; his homicidal action is therefore covered by a
justifying fact. But if this justifying fact is taken away the infraction,
whether ordinary crime or war crime, remains in its
entirety. To establish the justifying fact, the criminal action must
be necessary and proportional to the threat to which it responds.
The defendants, against whom justice is demanded of you, can
plead no such justification.
<span class='pageno' title='418' id='Page_418'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor can they escape their responsibility by arguing that they
were not the physical authors of the crimes. The war crime involves
two responsibilities, distinct and complementary: that of
the physical author and that of the instigator. There is nothing
heterodox in this conception. It is the faithful representation of
the criminal theory of complicity through instructions. The responsibility
of the accomplice, whether independent or complementary
to that of the principal author, is incontestable. The
defendants bear the entire responsibility for the crimes which were
committed upon their instructions or under their control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, these crimes cannot be justified by the pretext that an
order from above was given by Hitler to the defendants. The
theory of the justifying fact of an order from above has, in national
law, definite fixed limits; it does not cover the execution of orders
whose illegality is manifest. German law, moreover, assigns only
a limited rule to the concept of justification by orders from above.
Article 47 of the German Military Code of Justice of 1940, although
maintaining in principle that a criminal order from a superior
removes the responsibility of the agent, punishes the latter as an
accomplice, when he exceeded the orders received or when he
acted with knowledge of the criminal character of the act which
had been ordered. Goebbels once made this juridical concept the
theme of his propaganda. On 28 May 1944 he wrote in an article
in the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>, which was submitted to you by the
American Prosecution, an article intended to justify the murder
of Allied pilots by German mobs:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The pilots cannot validly claim that as soldiers they obeyed
orders. No law of war provides that a soldier will remain
unpunished for a hateful crime by referring to the orders of
his superiors, if their orders are in striking opposition to all
human ethics, to all international customs in the conduct of
war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Orders from a superior do not exonerate the agent of a manifest
crime from responsibility. Any other solution would, moreover,
be unacceptable, for it would testify to the impotence of all
repressive policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the more reason why orders from above cannot be the
justifying fact for the crimes of the defendants. Sir Hartley Shawcross
told you with eloquence that the accused cannot claim that
the Crimes against Peace were the doing of Hitler alone and that
they limited themselves to transmitting the general directives. War
Crimes may be compared to the will for aggression; they are the
common work of the defendants; the defendants bear a joint
responsibility for the criminal policy which resulted from the
National Socialist doctrine.
<span class='pageno' title='419' id='Page_419'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The responsibility, for German war criminality, because it constituted
a systematic policy, planned and prepared before the
opening of hostilities, and perpetrated without interruption from
1940 to 1945, rests with all the defendants, political or military
leaders, high officials of National Socialist Germany, and leaders
of the Nazi Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, some among them appear more directly responsible
for the acts taken as a whole, particularly those facts
connected with the French charges, that is to say, crimes committed
in the Western occupied territories or against the nationals
of those countries. We shall cite:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Göring as Director of the Four Year Plan and
President of the Cabinet of Ministers for Reich Defense; the Defendant
Ribbentrop in his capacity as Minister of Foreign Affairs in
charge of the administration of occupied countries; the Defendant
Frick in his capacity as Director of the Central Office for occupied
territories; the Defendant Funk in his capacity as Minister of Reich
Economy; the Defendant Keitel, inasmuch as he had command over
the occupation armies; the Defendant Jodl, associated in all the
responsibilities of the preceding defendant; the Defendant Seyss-Inquart
in his capacity as Reich Commissioner for the occupied
Dutch territory from 13 May 1940 to the end of the hostilities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will examine more particularly among these defendants, or
among others, those responsible for each category of acts, it being
understood that this enumeration is in no wise restrictive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Sauckel bears the chief responsibility for compulsory
labor in its various forms. As Plenipotentiary for Allocation
of Labor, he carried out the intensive recruiting of workers
by every possible means. He is in particular the signer of the
decree of 22 August 1942, which constitutes the charter for compulsory
labor in all occupied countries. He worked in liaison with
the Defendant Speer, Chief of the Todt Organization and Plenipotentiary
General for Armament in the office of the Four Year
Plan; as well as with the Defendant Funk, Minister of Reich
Economy; and with the Defendant Göring, Chief of the Four Year
Plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Göring participated directly in economic looting
in the same capacity. He appears often to have sought and derived
a personal profit from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Ribbentrop in his capacity as Minister of Foreign
Affairs was no stranger to these acts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Rosenberg, organizer and Chief of the Einsatzstab
Rosenberg, is particularly guilty of the looting of works of art
in the occupied countries.
<span class='pageno' title='420' id='Page_420'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The chief responsibility for the murders of hostages lies with
the Defendant Keitel, the drafter notably of the general order of 16
September 1941, with his assistant, the Defendant Jodl, and with
the Defendant Göring who agreed to the order in question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Kaltenbrunner, Himmler’s direct associate and
chief of all the foreign police and security offices, is directly
responsible for the monstrous devices to which the Gestapo had
recourse in all occupied countries, devices which are only the continuation
of the methods originated in the Gestapo by its founder,
in Prussia, the Defendant Göring. The Defendant Kaltenbrunner
is likewise directly responsible for the crimes committed in deportation
camps. Moreover, he visited these camps of deportation, as
will be proved by the French Delegation in the case of the Mauthausen
Camp. The Defendant Göring knew of and gave his
approval to the medical experiments made on prisoners. The
Defendant Sauckel forced prisoners by every possible means to
work under conditions, which were often inhuman, for the German
war production.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Keitel and his assistant, the Defendant Jodl, are
responsible for treatment contrary to the laws of war inflicted upon
war prisoners, for murders and killings to which they were
subjected, as well as for handing over great numbers of them to
the Gestapo. The Defendant Göring shares their responsibility for
the execution of Allied aviators and soldiers belonging to the
commando groups. The Defendant Sauckel directed the work of
war prisoners for the German war production in violation of international
law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Keitel and the Defendant Kaltenbrunner both
bear the chief responsibility for the terrorist actions carried out
jointly by the German Army and the police forces in the various
occupied countries and notably in France against the Resistance, as
well as for the devastations and massacres carried out against the
civilian population of several French departments. The Defendant
Jodl shares in this responsibility, most particularly through his
initial order, “Fight against Partisan Bands,” dated 6 May 1944,
which provides for “collective measures against the inhabitants
of entire villages.” These blows against mankind are the result
of racial theories of which the Defendant Hess, the Defendant
Rosenberg, and the Defendant Streicher are among the instigators
or propagandists. The Defendant Hess participated notably in the
elaboration of this subject, which is found in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Rosenberg, one of the principal theorists of
racial doctrine, exercised the function of special delegate for the
spiritual and ideological training of the Nazi Party. The Defendant
<span class='pageno' title='421' id='Page_421'></span>
Streicher showed himself to be one of the most violent anti-Semitic
agitators. In the execution of the policy of Germanization
and Nazification responsibility is shared between the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, that is to say, the Defendant Ribbentrop; the
General Staff, that is, the Defendants Keitel and Jodl; the Central
Office for all the occupied territories, that is, the Defendant Frick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The major National Socialist culprits had their orders carried
out in the divers Nazi organizations, which we ask you to declare
criminal, in order that each of their members may be then
apprehended and punished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Reich Cabinet, the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party, the
General Staff, the High Command of the German Armed Forces
represent only a small number of persons whose guilt and punishment
must ultimately result from the evidence, since they participated
personally and directly in the decisions, or ensured their
execution through some eminent person in the political or military
hierarchy, and without being able to ignore their criminal nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leaders of the Nazi Party are unquestionably in the forefront
of those who participated in the criminal enterprise, and
around the Defendants Keitel and Jodl the military High Command
directed the Army to the execution of hostages, to pillage, to
wanton destruction, and to massacres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But perhaps it will seem to you that the punishment of
hundreds of thousands of men who belonged to the SS, to the SD,
to the Gestapo, to the SA, will give rise to some objection. I should
like to try, should this be the case, to do away with that objection
by showing you the dreadful responsibilities of these men. Without
the existence of these organizations, without the spirit which animated
them, one could not understand how so many atrocities
could have been perpetrated. The systematic War Crimes could
not have been carried out by Nazi Germany without these organizations,
without the men who composed them. It is they who not
only executed but willed this body of crimes on behalf of Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may have seemed impossible to you that the monstrous
barbarity of the National Socialist doctrine could have been
imposed upon the German people, the heir, as are our people, of
the highest values of civilization. The education by the Nazi Party
of the young men who formed the SS, the SD, and the Gestapo,
explains the hold Nazism exercised over all Germany. They incarnated
National Socialism, and permitted it to accomplish, thanks
to the guilty passiveness of the whole German population, a part of
its purpose. This youth, those who carried out the tenets of the
regime, were trained in a veritable doctrine of immoralism, which
results from the ideology that inspired the regime. The myth of
<span class='pageno' title='422' id='Page_422'></span>
the race removed from war in the eyes of these disciples of Nazism
its criminal character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If it is proved that a superior race is to annihilate races and
peoples that are considered inferior and decadent, incapable of
living a life as it should be lived, before what means of extermination
will they recoil? This is the ethics of immorality, the
result of the most authentic Nietzscheism, which considers that the
destruction of all conventional ethics is the supreme duty of man.
The crime against race is punished without pity. The crime on
behalf of race is exalted without limit. The regime truly creates a
logic of crime which obeys its own laws, which has no connection
whatsoever with what we consider ethical. With such a point of
view, all horrors could have been justified and authorized. So
many acts which appear incomprehensible to us, so greatly do they
clash with our customary notions, were explained, were formulated
in advance in the name of the racial community.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Add that these atrocities and these cruelties were perpetrated
within the rigid framework created by the “esprit de corps,” by the
soldierly solidarity which bound individuals and insured the legitimacy
of the crime an unlimited field of action. The individuals who
committed them would not only be covered by the regime itself,
but spurred on by the discipline and the “camaraderie” of these
corps, imbued with Nazi criminality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi youth was invited to go through an extraordinary
adventure. Having unlimited power at its disposal, thanks to the
Party and its massive grip, it was first of all called upon to implement
the grandiose dreams of National Socialist Pan-Germanism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Party exercised a rigid selection of its youth, and
neglected no incentive. It solicited from its youth the desire to
distinguish itself, to accomplish exploits beyond the common order
and beyond nature. The young Nazis in the Gestapo and the SS
knew that their acts, no matter how cruel or how inhumane they
might be, would always be judged legitimate by the regime, in
the name of the racial community, of its needs, and of its triumphs.
The Nazi Party, thanks to the young men of the SS, of the SD,
and of the Gestapo, had thus become capable of accomplishing in
the field of criminality what no other person or nation could have
committed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The members of these organizations became voluntarily the
authors of these innumerable crimes of all kinds, often executed
with disconcerting cynicism and with artful sadism in the concentration
camps of Germany as well as in the various occupied
countries, and especially in those of Western Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crimes are monstrous. The crimes and the responsibility
for them have definitely been established. There is no possible
<span class='pageno' title='423' id='Page_423'></span>
doubt. Nevertheless throughout these tranquil sessions of this
Trial, extraordinary in the history of the world, in view of the
exceptional nature of the justice which your High Tribunal is
called upon to render before the United Nations and the German
people and before all mankind a few objections may arise in our
minds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is our duty to discuss this exhaustively, even if it is only
sub-conscious in us, for soon a pseudo-patriotic propaganda may
take hold of Germany, and even may echo in some of our countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who can say: I have a clean conscience, I am without fault?
To use different weights and measures is abhorred by God.” This
text from the Holy Scriptures (Proverbs XX, 9-10) has already
been mentioned here and there; it will serve tomorrow as a theme
of propaganda, but above all, it is profoundly written in our souls.
Rising in the name of our martyred people as accusers of Nazi
Germany, we have never for a moment repressed it as a distasteful
reminder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, no nation is without reproach in its history, just as no
individual is faultless in his life. Yes, every war in itself brings
forth iniquitous evils and entails almost necessarily individual and
collective crimes, because it easily unleashes in man the evil passions
which always slumber there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we can examine our conscience fearlessly in the face of the
Nazi culprits; we find no common measure between them and
ourselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If this criminality had been accidental; if Germany had been
forced into war, if crimes had been committed only in the excitement
of combat, we might question ourselves in the light of the
Scriptures. But the war was prepared and deliberated upon long
in advance, and upon the very last day it would have been easy
to avoid it without sacrificing any of the legitimate interests of the
German people. And the atrocities were perpetrated during the
war, not under the influence of a mad passion nor of a war-like
anger nor of an avenging resentment, but as a result of cold calculation,
of perfectly conscious methods, of a pre-existing doctrine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truly diabolical enterprise of Hitler and of his companions
was to assemble in a body of dogmas formed around the concept
of race, all the instincts of barbarism, repressed by centuries of
civilization, but always present in men’s innermost nature, all the
negations of the traditional values of humanity, on which nations,
as well as individuals, question their conscience in the troubled
hours of their development and of their life; to construct and to
propagate a doctrine which organizes, regulates, and aspires to
command crime.
<span class='pageno' title='424' id='Page_424'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The diabolical enterprise of Hitler and of his companions was
also to appeal to the forces of evil in order to establish his domination
over the German people and subsequently the domination of
Germany over Europe and perhaps over the world. It planned to
incorporate organized criminality into a system of government,
into a system of international relations, and into a system of
warfare, by unleashing within a whole nation the most savage
passions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nationalism and serving their people and their country will
perhaps be their explanation. Far from constituting an excuse, if
any excuse were possible in view of the enormity of their crime,
these explanations would make it still more serious. They have
profaned the sacred idea of the fatherland by linking it to a willed
return to barbarism. In its name they obtained—half by force, half
by persuasion—the adherence of a whole country, formerly among
the greatest in the order of spiritual values, and have lowered it
to the lowest level. The moral confusion, the economic difficulties,
the obsession with the defeat of 1918 and with the loss of might
and the Pan-Germanic tradition are the basis of the empire of
Hitler and of his companions over a people thrown off its balance;
to abandon oneself to force, to renounce moral concern, to satisfy
a love of collectivity, to revel in lack of restraint are the natural
temptations strongly implanted in the German, which the Nazi
leaders exploited with cynicism. The intoxication of success and
the madness of greatness completed the picture and put practically
all Germans, some without doubt unconsciously, in the service of
the National Socialist doctrine by associating them with the diabolical
enterprise of their Führer and his companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Opposing this enterprise men of various countries and different
classes rose, all of them animated by the common bond of their
human lot. France and Great Britain entered the war only to
remain faithful to their given word. The peoples of the occupied
countries, tortured in body and soul, never renounced their liberty
nor their cultural values, and it was a magnificent epic of clandestine
opposition and of Resistance which through a splendid
heroism testifies to the spontaneous refusal of the populations to
accept the Nazi myths. Millions and millions of men of the Soviet
Union fell to defend not only the soil and independence of their
country, but also their humanitarian universalism. The millions
of British and American soldiers who landed on our unhappy
continent carried in their hearts the ideal of freeing from Nazi
oppression both the occupied countries and the peoples who willingly
or by force had become the satellites of the Axis and the
German people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were all of them together, whether in uniform or not,
fighters for the great hope which throughout the centuries has been
<span class='pageno' title='425' id='Page_425'></span>
nourished by the suffering of the peoples, the great hope for a better
future for mankind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes this great hope expresses itself with difficulty or
loses its way or deceives itself or knows the dread return to barbarism,
but it persists always and finally constitutes the powerful
lever which brings about the progress of humanity despite everything.
These aspirations always reborn, these concerns constantly
awakened, this anguish unceasingly present, this perpetual combat
against evil form in a definitive manner the sublime grandeur of
man. National Socialism only yesterday imperiled all of this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that gigantic struggle where two ideologies, two conceptions
of life were at grips, in the name of the people whom we
represent here and in the name of the great human hope for which
they have so greatly suffered, so greatly fought, we can without
fear and with a clean conscience rise as accusers of the leaders of
Nazi Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Mr. Justice Jackson said so eloquently at the opening of this
Trial, “Civilization could not survive if these crimes were to be
committed again,” and he added, “The true plaintiff in this Court
is civilization.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Civilization requires from you after this unleashing of barbarism
a verdict which will also be a sort of supreme warning at the
hour when humanity appears still at times to enter the path of
the organization of peace only with apprehension and hesitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If we wish that on the morrow of the cataclysm of war the
sufferings of martyred countries, the sacrifices of victorious nations,
and also the expiation of guilty people will engender a better
humanity, justice must strike those guilty of the enterprise of
barbarism from which we have just escaped. The reign of justice
is the most exact expression of the great human hope. Your
decision can mark a decisive stage in its difficult pursuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Undoubtedly even today, this justice and this punishment have
become possible only because, as a first condition, free peoples
emerged victorious from the conflict. This is actually the link
between the force of the victors and the guilt of the vanquished
leaders who appear before Your High Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this link signifies nothing else but the revelation of the
wisdom of nations that justice, in order to impose itself effectively
and constantly upon individuals and upon nations, must have
force at its disposal. The common will to put force in the service
of justice inspires our nations and commands our whole civilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This resolution is brilliantly confirmed today in a judicial case
where the facts are examined scrupulously in all their aspects,
<span class='pageno' title='426' id='Page_426'></span>
the penal nature of the offense rigorously established, the competency
of the Tribunal incontestable, the rights of the defense intact,
total publicity insured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your judgment pronounced under these conditions can serve
as a foundation for the moral uplift of the German people, first
stage in its integration into the community of free countries.
Without your judgment, history might incur the risk of repeating
itself, crime would become epic, and the National Socialist enterprise
a last Wagnerian tragedy; and new Pan-Germanists would
soon say to the Germans:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Hitler and his companions were wrong because they finally
failed, but we must begin again some day, on other foundations,
the extraordinary adventure of Germanism.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After your judgment, if only we know how to enlighten this
people and watch over their first steps on the road to liberty,
National Socialism will be inscribed permanently in their history
as the crime of crimes which could lead it only to material and
moral perdition, as the doctrine which they should forever avoid
with horror and scorn in order to remain faithful or rather become
once more faithful to the great norms of common civilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eminent international jurist and noble European, Politis,
in his posthumous book entitled <span class='it'>International Ethics</span> reminds us
that, like all ethical rules, those which should govern international
relations will never be definitely established unless all peoples
succeed in convincing themselves that there is definitely a greater
profit to be gained by observing them than by transgressing them.
That is why your judgment can contribute to the enlightenment
of the German people and of all peoples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your judgment must be inscribed as a decisive act in the history
of international law in order to prepare the establishment of a
true international society excluding recourse to war and enlisting
force permanently in the service of the justice of nations; it will
be one of the foundations of this peaceful order to which nations
aspire on the morrow of this frightful torment. The need for
justice of the martyred peoples will be satisfied, and their sufferings
will not have been useless to the progress of mankind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. De Menthon, would you prefer to continue
the case on behalf of France this afternoon, or would you
prefer to adjourn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DE MENTHON: We are at the disposal of the Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well then, if that is so, then I think we
better go on until 5 o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DE MENTHON: It might be preferable to adjourn, because
M. Faure’s brief which is going to be presented will last at least
<span class='pageno' title='427' id='Page_427'></span>
an hour. Perhaps it is better to adjourn until tomorrow morning.
However, we will remain at the disposal of the Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: When you said that the proof which will
now be presented would take an hour, do you mean by that that
it is an introductory statement or is it a part of the main case
which you are presenting?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DE MENTHON: Your Honor, it is part of the general case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would it not be possible then to go on until
5 o’clock?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DE MENTHON: Yes, quite so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. EDGAR FAURE (Deputy Chief Prosecutor for the French
Republic): Mr. President and Your Honor, I propose to submit to
the Tribunal an introduction dealing with the first and the second
part of the French case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first part relates to forced labor; the second part to economic
looting. These two over-all questions are complementary to
each other and form a whole. Manpower on the one hand and
material property on the other constitute the two aspects of the
riches of a country and the living conditions in that country.
Measures taken with regard to the one necessarily react on the
other, and it is understandable that in the occupied countries
German policy with regard to manpower and economic property
was inspired from the very beginning by common directing
principles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this reason the French Prosecution has deemed it logical
to submit successively to the Tribunal those two briefs corresponding
to the letters “H” and “E” of the third Count of the
Indictment. My present purpose is to define these initial directives
covering the German procedure in regard to manpower and to
material in the occupied territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Germans occupied the territories of Denmark, Norway,
Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and part of continental France,
they thereby assumed a material power of constraint with regard
to the inhabitants and a material power of acquisition with regard
to its property. They thus had in fact the possibility of utilizing
these dual resources on behalf of the war effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, legally they were confronted with precise
rules of international law relating to the occupation of territories
by the military forces of a belligerent state. These rules very
strictly limit the rights of the occupant, who may requisition
property and services solely for the needs of the army of occupation.
I here allude to the regulation annexed to the Convention
concerning the Laws and Customs of War signed at The Hague on
<span class='pageno' title='428' id='Page_428'></span>
18 October 1907, Section III, and in particular to the Articles 46,
47, 49, 52, and 53. If it please the Tribunal, I shall merely cite
the paragraph of Article 52 which defines in a perfectly exact
manner the lawful conditions of requisition of persons and property:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Requisitions in kind and of services may be demanded
of communities or of inhabitants only for the needs of
the army of occupation. They will be proportionate to the
resources of the country and of such a nature that they do
not imply for the population the obligation of taking part
in war operations against their native country.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These various articles must, moreover, be considered in the
general spirit defined in the preamble of the Convention, from
which I take the liberty of reading the last paragraph to the
Tribunal:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Until such time as a more complete code of the laws of
war can be enacted, the High Contracting Parties deem
it opportune to state that in cases not included in the
regulations adopted by them, populations and belligerents
remain under the safeguard and direction of the principles
of the law of nations derived from the established usages
among civilized nations, the laws of humanity, and the
requirements of public conscience.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From this point of view it is very evident that the total exploitation
of the resources of occupied countries for the benefit of the
enemy’s war economy is absolutely contrary to the law of nations
and to the requirements of public conscience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Germany signed the Hague Convention and it must be pointed
out that she made no reservations at that time except with regard
to Article 44, which relates to the supply of information to the
belligerents. She made no reservation with regard to the articles
which we have cited nor with regard to the preamble. These
articles and the preamble, moreover, reiterate the corresponding
text of the previous Hague Convention of 28 July 1899.</p>

<p class='pindent'>German official ratifications of the Conventions were given on
4 September 1900 and 27 November 1909. I have purposely recalled
these well-known facts in order to emphasize that the Germans
could not fail to recognize the constant principles of international
law to which they subscribed on two occasions, long before their
defeat in 1918 and consequently outside the alleged pressure to
which they referred in regard to the Treaty of Versailles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While on this subject of juridical theory, may I point out
that in the arrangement signed at Versailles on 28 June 1919 in
connection with the military occupation of the territories of the
<span class='pageno' title='429' id='Page_429'></span>
Rhine, reference is made in Article 6 to the Hague Convention
in the following terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The right of requisition in kind and in services as formulated
by the Hague Convention of 1907 will be exercised by
the allied and associate armies of occupation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, the governing principles of the rights of requisition by
the occupiers is confirmed by a third international agreement
subscribed to by Germany, who in regard to the occupation of
her own territory is here the beneficiary of this limitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What, then, will the conduct of the Germans be like, in view
of this factual situation, which involves power and temptation,
and in view of this legal situation which involves a limitation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal is already aware, by virtue of the general presentation
of the American Prosecution, that the conduct of the Germans
was to profit by the fact and to ignore the law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans systematically violated international rules and
the law of nations, as far as we are concerned, both by forced
labor and by spoliation. Detailed illustrations of these acts in the
Western countries will be laid before you in the briefs which
will follow my own. For my part I propose to concentrate for
a moment on the actual concepts which the Germans had from
the outset. In this connection I shall submit to the Tribunal three
complementary propositions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First Proposition: From the very beginning of the occupation,
the Germans decided, in the interests of their war effort, to seize
in any way possible all the resources, both material and human,
of the occupied countries. Their plan was not to take any account
of legal limitations. It is not under the spur of occasional necessity
that they subsequently perpetrated their illicit acts, but in pursuance
of a deliberate intention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Second Proposition: However, the Germans took pains to mask
their real intentions; they did not make known that they rejected
international juridical rules. On the contrary, they gave assurance
that they would respect them. The reasons for this camouflage are
easy to understand. The Germans were anxious from the beginning
to spare public opinion in the occupied territory. Brutal
proceedings would have aroused immediate resistance which would
have hampered their actions. They also wished to deceive world
opinion, and more particularly American public opinion, since
the United States of America had at that time not yet entered
the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third proposition which I lay before the Tribunal results
from the first two. As the Germans contemplated achieving their
aims and masking their intentions, they were of necessity bound
<span class='pageno' title='430' id='Page_430'></span>
to organize a system of irregular means, while maintaining an
appearance of legality. The complexity and the technical character
of the proceedings they used enabled them easily to conceal the
real state of affairs from the uninitiated or the merely uninformed.
These disguised means proved, in fact, just as efficient and perhaps
even more so than would have been brutal seizure. They moreover
enabled the Germans to have recourse to such brutal action the
day they deemed that this would yield them more advantages
than inconvenience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are of the opinion that this analysis of the German intentions
is of interest to the Tribunal for, on the one hand, it
demonstrates that the illicit acts were premeditated and that their
authors were aware of their reprehensible character; and on the
other hand, it enables one to understand the scope and extent of
these acts, despite the precautions taken to mask them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence which the Prosecution will submit to the Tribunal
refers chiefly to the second and third propositions, for as regards
the first, that is to say, the criminal intention and premeditation,
it is demonstrated by the discrepancy between the facade and
reality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I say in the first place that the Germans at the time of the
occupation made a pretense of observing the rules of international
law. Here is, by way of example, a proclamation to the French
population, signed by the Commander-in-Chief of the German
Army. This is a public document which is reproduced in the
<span class='it'>Official Journal</span>, containing the decrees issued by the military
governor for French occupied territories, Number 1 dated 4 July
1940. I submit to the Tribunal this document, which will bear
Number RF-1 of the French documentation; and from it I cite
merely the following sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The troops have received the order to treat the population
with regard and to respect private property provided the
population remains calm.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans proceeded in identical manner in all the occupied
countries. I also submit to the Tribunal the text of the same
proclamation, dated 10 May 1940, which was published in the
<span class='it'>Official Journal</span> of the Commander-in-Chief in Belgium and in the
north of France, Number 1, Page 1, under the title “Proclamation
to the Population of Belgium.” The German text, as well as the
Flemish text, bear the more complete title, “Proclamation to the
Population of Holland and Belgium.” In view of the identical
nature of these texts, this copy may be considered as Document
Number RF-1 (bis) of the French documentation.
<span class='pageno' title='431' id='Page_431'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I now submit another proclamation entitled, “To the Inhabitants
of Occupied Countries!” dated 10 May 1940, and signed “The Commander-in-Chief
of the Army Group.” This is likewise published
in the <span class='it'>Official Journal</span> of German ordinances. This will be Document
Number RF-2 of the French documentation. I will cite the
first two paragraphs:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Commander-in-Chief of the German Army has given
me authority to announce the following:</p>
<hr class='tbk443'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I. The German Army guarantees the inhabitants full personal
security and the safeguard of their property. Those
who behave peacefully and quietly have nothing to fear.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I also quote passages from Paragraphs V, VI, and VII:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“V. The administrative authorities of the state, communities,
the police, and schools shall continue their activities. They
therefore remain at the service of their own population.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk444'/>
<p class='noindent'>“VI. All enterprises, businesses, and banks will continue
their work in the interest of the population.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk445'/>
<p class='noindent'>“VII. Producers of goods of prime necessity, as well as
merchants, shall continue their activities and place their
goods at the disposal of the public.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The passages which I have just quoted are not the literal
reproduction of international conventions, but they reflect their
spirit. Repetition of the terms, “at the service of the population,”
“in the interest of the population,” “at the disposal of the public”
must necessarily be construed as an especially firm assurance
that the resources of the country and its manpower will be
preserved for that country and not diverted in favor of the German
war effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We pass now Document under Number RF-2 (bis) to the next
of the same proclamations signed by the Commander-in-Chief of
the Army Group and published in the <span class='it'>Official Journal</span> of the
Commander-in-Chief in Belgium, numbered as above, Page 3.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, on 22 June 1940, an armistice convention was signed
between the representatives of the German Government and the
representatives of the <span class='it'>de facto</span> authority which was at that time
assuming the Government of France. This convention is likewise
a public document. It will be submitted to the Tribunal at a
later stage as the first document of the economic case. At this
stage I merely wish to cite a sentence of Paragraph 3, which reads
as follows: “In the occupied districts of France the German Reich
exercises all the rights of an occupying power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This constitutes then a very definite reference to international
law. Moreover, the German plenipotentiaries gave in this respect
complementary oral assurances. On this matter I submit to the
Tribunal, in the form of French Exhibit Number RF-3 (Document
<span class='pageno' title='432' id='Page_432'></span>
RF-3), an extract from the deposition made by Ambassador Leon
Noel in the course of proceedings before the French High Court
of Justice. This extract is reproduced from a book entitled
<span class='it'>Transcript in extenso of the Sessions of the Trial of Marshal Pétain</span>,
printed in Paris in 1945 at the printing office of the official
journals and constitutes a document admissible as evidence in
accordance with the Charter of the Tribunal, Article 21. This is
the statement of M. Leon Noel, which I desire to cite to the
Tribunal. M. Leon Noel was a member of the French Armistice
Delegation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you going to present this document to us?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: This document is presented to the Tribunal. We
have given to the Tribunal the transcript of the proceedings, and
in the book of documents the Tribunal will find the excerpt I am
now quoting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We are not in possession of it at present.
I do not know where it is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I think that possibly this document was handed
to the Secretariat of the Tribunal rather late, but it will be here
immediately. May it please the Tribunal, I merely intend to read
a short extract from this document today.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will have it tomorrow, I hope?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Certainly, Mr. President.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>[<span class='it'>Quoting.</span>] “I have also obtained a certain number of replies
from German generals which I believe could have been
subsequently used—from General Jodl, who in the month of
May last signed at Reims the unconditional surrender of
Germany and from General (subsequently Marshal) Keitel,
who a few weeks later was to sign in Berlin the ratification
of this surrender. In this way I led them to declare in
the most categorical manner that in no event would they
interfere with administration, that the rights which they
claimed for themselves under the convention were purely
and simply those which in similar circumstances international
law and international usage concede to occupation armies,
that is to say, those indispensable for the maintenance of
security, transportation, and the food supply needs of these
armies.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These assertions and promises on the part of the Germans were
therefore formal. Now, even at that time, they were not sincere.
Indeed, not only did the Germans subsequently violate them, but
from the very beginning they organized a system whereby they
<span class='pageno' title='433' id='Page_433'></span>
were enabled to accomplish these violations in the most efficacious
manner and at the same time in a manner which enabled them
to some extent to mask them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as economy and labor are concerned, this German system
comes from a very simple idea. It consisted in supervising production
at its beginning and its end. On the one hand, the
Germans embarked immediately upon the general requisitioning
of all raw materials and all goods in the occupied countries. Thenceforth,
it would depend upon them to supply, or not to supply, raw
material to the national industry. They were thus in a position to
develop one branch of production rather than another, to favor
certain undertakings, and, inversely, to oblige other undertakings
to close down. As events and opportunities demanded, they organized
this appropriation of raw materials, principally with a view to
facilitating their distribution in their own interest but the principle
was continuously maintained. They thus held, as it were, the key
of entrance to production. On the other hand, they also held the
exit key, that is to say, of finance. By securing the financial
means in the form of the money of an occupied country, the
Germans were able to purchase products and to acquire, under
the pretense of legality, the output of the economic activity of the
country. In point of fact, the Germans obtained for themselves
from the outset such considerable financial means that they were
easily able to absorb the entire productive capacity of each country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Tribunal finds it suitable, I will interrupt at this point.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 18 January 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='434' id='Page_434'></span><h1>THIRTY-SEVENTH DAY<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>Friday, 18 January 1946</span></h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Mr. President, Your Honors. At yesterday’s session
I explained to the Tribunal the principles of the provisions made
by the Germans to ensure the seizure of raw materials and the
control of finance in the occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These provisions will be demonstrated by numerous documents
which will be presented to the Tribunal in the course of the presentation
of the case on economic spoliation and forced labor. I
shall not quote these documents at this moment since, as I pointed
out yesterday, the purpose of my introduction is limited to the
initial concepts of the Germans in these matters. I shall cite
only one document, which reveals the true intentions of the
Germans in the very first period. This document bears our Document
Number RF-3 (bis), and I offer it in evidence to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It relates particularly to Norway. It consists of a photostatic
copy, certified, of a transcript of a conference held in Oslo,
21 November 1940, under the presidency of the Reich Commissioner.
I would point out to the Tribunal that we submit this
document as being particularly significant, because Norway is a
country which was occupied at a very early date by the Germans.
The date of 21 November 1940, which you see, refers to the very
earliest period of the German occupation, and moreover, in the
text of the conference, allusion is made to the situation of the
7 months preceding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You will find there the exact psychology of the occupation as
it existed in this period of April 1940 to November 1940, that
is to say, at the time, or even before, when the Germans, while
invading other countries, made the reassuring proclamations which
I read to the Tribunal yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were 40 personages present at the conference, of whom
State Secretary Dr. Landfried represented the Reich Ministry of
Economics. This is how the Reich Commissioner expresses himself:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Today’s conference is the continuation of a conference which
was held in Berlin. On this occasion I should like, first of
all, to stress and establish definitely that the collaboration
between the Wehrmacht and the Reich Commissioner is
<span class='pageno' title='435' id='Page_435'></span>
exemplary. I must protest against the idea that the Wehrmacht
carried out its financial task here in a muddled and
irresponsible manner. We must also take into account the
particular circumstances which then prevailed in Norway
and which still partially prevail.</p>
<hr class='tbk446'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Certain tasks were fixed by the Führer which were to be
carried out within a given time.</p>
<hr class='tbk447'/>
<p class='noindent'>“At the conference in Berlin the following points were settled,
which we can take as a basis of today’s conference. There is
no doubt that the country of Norway was utilized for the
execution of the tasks of the Wehrmacht during the last
7 months in such a way that a further drain on the country
without some compensation is no longer possible in view of
the future tasks of the Wehrmacht.</p>
<hr class='tbk448'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I considered it from the beginning my obvious duty in my
capacity as Reich Commissioner to devote my activities to
mobilizing all the economic and material forces of the country
for the purposes of the Wehrmacht and not to call on the
resources of the Reich as long as I am in a position to
organize such resources in the country.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I will stop quoting the words of the Reich Commissioner at
this point, and now I shall cite the terms of the reply of Dr.
Landfried, which you will find a little lower down in the document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I am very glad to be able to state that we have succeeded here
in Norway .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in mobilizing the economic forces of Norway
for German needs to an extent which it has not been possible
to attain in all the other occupied countries. I must thank you
especially in the name of the Minister of Economics for
having succeeded in inducing the Norwegians to achieve the
greatest possible results.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I think the Tribunal will have observed the series of expressions
which are used in this document and which are quite characteristic.
The Reich Commissioner says that from the very beginning, his duty
was to mobilize all the economic and material forces of the country
for the purposes of the Wehrmacht, and Dr. Landfried answers
that they succeeded in mobilizing the economic forces to an extent
which it has not been possible to attain in all the other occupied
territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus we see that Dr. Landfried does not say that the Germans
had, in Norway, a particular concept of occupation and that in the
other countries they used a different procedure; he says that it was
not possible to do as well in the other countries. The only limitation
he recognizes is a limit of fact and opportunity, which will soon
be overcome, but in no wise a limitation of law. The idea of a legal
<span class='pageno' title='436' id='Page_436'></span>
limitation never enters his mind, any more than it comes to the
mind of any of the 40 personages present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not here a question of an opinion or initiative of a regional
administrative authority, but rather of the official doctrine of the
Reich Cabinet and the High Command, since 40 high officials were
present at this conference, and especially the representative of the
Minister for Economy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to stress at this point that this German doctrine
and these German methods for the mobilization of the resources of
the occupied countries necessarily extend to the labor of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said yesterday that the Germans ensured for themselves from
the very beginning the two keys of production. By that very fact
they had within their power the working capital and the manpower.
It depended on their decision whether labor worked or did not
work, whether there should or should not be unemployment. This
explains in a general way why the Germans took such brutal
measures as the displacement and the mobilization of workers only
after a certain time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first period, that is to say, as long as there existed in the
occupied countries stocks and raw materials, it was more in the
interests of the Germans to utilize labor locally, at least to a great
extent. This labor permitted them to produce for their benefit, with
the wealth of these countries, finished products which they seized.
Thus, besides the moral advantage of safeguarding appearances,
they avoided the initial transportation of raw materials. The
consideration of transport difficulties was always very important
in the German war economy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when after a time, which was more or less long, the occupied
countries were impoverished in their raw materials and really
ruined, then the Germans no longer had any interest in permitting
labor to work on the spot. They would, indeed, have had to furnish
the raw materials themselves, and consequently that would involve
double transportation—that of raw material in one direction and
that of the finished products in the other direction. At that moment
it became more advantageous for them to export workmen. This
consideration coincided, moreover, with the needs resulting from
the economic situation of Germany at that time and with political
considerations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this question of the use of labor, I shall read to the Tribunal
a few sentences of a document which I offer under Document Number
RF-4. It is therefore the document following that from which I
have just read. The note which you will find in the document book
reproduces the sentences from an article which appeared in the
newspaper <span class='it'>Pariser Zeitung</span> on 17 July 1942.
<span class='pageno' title='437' id='Page_437'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I offer at the same time to the Tribunal a certified photostatic
copy of the page of the newspaper, which is from the collection
of the Bibliothèque Nationale. This article is signed by Dr. Michel,
who was the Chief of the Economic Administration in France. Its
title is “Two Years of Controlled Economy in France.” It is then an
article written for the purpose of German propaganda since it
appeared in a German newspaper which published one page in
French in Paris. Naturally I wish to point out to the Tribunal that
we in no way accept all the ideas which are presented in this
article, but we should like to point out several sentences of Dr.
Michel’s as revealing the same sort of procedure about which I
was speaking just now, which consisted of utilizing labor, first on
the spot, as long as there was raw material, and then deporting
that labor to Germany:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In order to utilize the productive forces of French industry,
the Reich began by transferring to France its orders for
industrial articles for the war effort.</p>
<hr class='tbk449'/>
<p class='noindent'>“One single figure is sufficient to show the success of this
transfer of German orders: The value of the transactions to
date is expressed in a figure surpassing hundreds of thousands
of millions of francs. New blood is circulating in the veins
of French economy, which is working to the utmost of its
capacity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Some sentences in the original are omitted here, as they are of
no interest, and I would like to read the following sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As the stocks of raw materials tended to diminish on account
of the length of the war, the recruitment of available
French labor began.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Michel uses here elegant ways of expressing himself, which
cover the reality, that is to say, the beginning of the transfer of
workmen at the moment when raw materials, which the Germans
had appropriated from the beginning, had begun to be exhausted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conclusion which I would now like to give to my statement
is the following: That the Germans have always considered labor,
human labor, as a factor for their use. This attitude existed even
before the official institution of compulsory labor, of which we
will speak to you presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Germans the work of others has always been compulsory
and for their profit, and it was meant to remain so even after the
end of the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is this last point that I should like to emphasize, for it shows
the extent and the gravity of the German conception and of the
German projects. I shall quote in relation to this a document
which will bear the Number RF-5 in our document book. Here
<span class='pageno' title='438' id='Page_438'></span>
is the document, which I submit to the Tribunal. It is a work
published in French in Berlin in 1943, by Dr. Friedrich Didier, entitled
<span class='it'>Workers for Europe</span>. It was issued by the central publishing house
of the National Socialist Party. It begins with a preface by the
Defendant Sauckel, whose facsimile signature is printed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall quote to the Tribunal a paragraph from this work, which
is the last page in my document book. It is Document Number
RF-5 and this sentence is found on Page 23. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“A great percentage of foreign workers will remain, even
after victory, in our territory, in order to complete then—having
been trained in construction work—what the outbreak
of war had prevented, and to carry out those planned projects
which up to now had remained unrealized.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, in a work of propaganda, consequently written with great
prudence and with intent to seduce, we nevertheless find this main
admission by the Germans, that they intended to keep, even after
the war, the workers of other countries in order to insure the
greatness of Germany without any limitation of aim or time. Hence
it is a matter of a policy of perpetual exploitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If it please the Tribunal, my introduction having come to an
end, M. Herzog will present the brief relating to forced labor in
France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. JACQUES B. HERZOG (Assistant Prosecutor for the French
Republic): Mr. President and Your Honors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The National Socialist doctrine, by the pre-eminence which it
gives to the idea of the State, by the contempt in which it holds
individuals and personal rights, contains a conception of work
which agrees with the principles of its general philosophy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For it, work is not one of the forms of the manifestation of
individual personalities; it is a duty imposed by the community on
its members.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The relationship of labor, according to National Socialist ideas,”
a German writer has said, “is not a simple judicial relationship between
the worker and his employer; it is a living phenomenon in
which the worker becomes a cog in the National Socialist machine
for collective production.” The conception of compulsory labor is
thus, for National Socialism, necessarily complementary to the
conception of work itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compulsory labor service was first of all imposed on the German
people. German labor service was instituted by a law of 26 June
1935 which bears Hitler’s signature and that of the Defendant
Frick, Minister of the Interior. This law was published in the
<span class='pageno' title='439' id='Page_439'></span>
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, Page 769. I submit it to the Tribunal as
Exhibit Number RF-6 (Document Number 1389-PS).</p>

<p class='pindent'>From 1939 the mobilization of workers was added to the compulsory
labor service. Decrees were promulgated to that effect by the
Defendant Göring in his capacity as Delegate for the Four Year Plan.
I do not stress this point; it arises from the conspiracy entered into
by the accused to commit their Crimes against Peace, and which my
American colleagues have already brought to the attention of the
Tribunal. I merely point out that the mobilization of workers was
applicable to foreigners resident in German territory, because I
find in this fact the proof that the principle of compulsory recruitment
of foreign workers existed prior to the war. Far from being
the spontaneous result of the needs of German war industry, the
compulsory recruitment of foreign workers is the putting into
practice of a concerted policy. I lay before the Tribunal a document
which proves this. It is Document C-2 of the French
classification, which I offer as Exhibit Number RF-7. This is a
memorandum of the High Command of the German Armed Forces
of 1 October 1938. This memorandum, drawn up in anticipation of
the invasion of Czechoslovakia, contains a classification of violations
possible under international law. In connection with each violation
appears the explanation which the High Command of the Armed
Forces thinks it possible to give. The document appears in the
form of a list in four columns. In the first is a statement of the
violations of international law; the second gives a concrete example;
the third contains the point of view of international law on the
one hand and, on the other hand, the conclusions which can be
drawn from it; the fourth column is reserved for the explanation
of the Propaganda Ministry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I read the passage which deals with the forced labor of civilians
and prisoners of war, which is found on Page 6 of the German
original, Page 7 of the French translation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Use of prisoners of war and civilians for war work, (construction
of roads, digging trenches, making munitions,
employment in transport, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>).”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Second column:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Captured Czech soldiers or Czech civilians are ordered to
construct roads or to load munitions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The third column:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 31 of an agreement signed 27 July 1939 concerning the
treatment of prisoners of war forbids their use in tasks
directly related to war measures. Compulsion to do such
work is in every case contrary to international law. The use
of prisoners of war as well as civilians is allowed for road
construction but forbidden for the manufacture of munitions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='440' id='Page_440'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Last column:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The use of these measures may be based on war needs or
on the declaration that the enemy has acted in the same
way first.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The compulsory recruitment of foreign workers is thus in
accordance with National Socialist doctrine, one of the elements of
the policy of German domination. Hitler himself recognized this
on several occasions. I quote in this connection his speech of
9 November 1941 which was printed in the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> of
10 November 1941, Number 314, Page 4, which I submit to the
Tribunal under Document Number RF-8. I read the extract of
this discourse, Columns 1 and 2, and the first paragraph below,
in the German original:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The territory which now works for us contains more than
250 million men, but the territory in Europe which works
indirectly for this battle includes now more than 350 million.</p>
<hr class='tbk450'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As far as German territory is concerned, the territory
occupied by us and that which we have taken under our
administration, there is no doubt that we shall succeed in
harnessing every man for this work.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The recruitment of foreign workers thus proceeds in a systematic
manner. It constitutes the putting into practice of the political
principles as applied to the territories occupied by Germany. These
principles, the concrete development of which in other departments
of German criminal activity will be pointed out to you by my
colleagues, are essentially of two kinds: employment of all active
forces of the occupied or dominated territories; extermination of all
their non-productive forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These are the two reasons which the defendants gave in justification
for the establishment of the recruitment of foreign workers.
There are many documents to this effect; I confine myself to the
most explicit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The justification for the recruitment of foreign workers, because
of the necessity of including the peoples of the enslaved states in
the German war effort, is primarily a result of the explanatory
statement of the decree of 21 March 1942, appointing the Defendant
Sauckel as Plenipotentiary for Allocation of Labor. The decree was
published in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1942, Part I, Page 179. I submit
it and will read its complete text to the Tribunal, as Document
Number RF-9.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The decree of the Führer concerning the creation of a
Plenipotentiary for Allocation of Labor, dated 21 March 1942.
<span class='pageno' title='441' id='Page_441'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk451'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The assurance of the required manpower for the whole war
economy, and in particular for the armament industry, necessitates
a uniform direction, meeting the needs of the war economy,
of all available labor, including hired foreigners and
prisoners of war, as well as the mobilization of all unused
labor still in the Greater German Reich, including the
Protectorate as well as the Government General and the
occupied territories.</p>
<hr class='tbk452'/>
<p class='noindent'>“This mission will be accomplished by Reichsstatthalter and
Gauleiter Fritz Sauckel in the capacity of Plenipotentiary
General for Allocation of Labor. In this capacity he is
directly responsible to the Delegate for the Four Year Plan.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I would like to point out here that the Defendant Sauckel
developed the same theme at the Congress of Gauleiter and Reichsleiter
held 5 and 6 February 1943 at Posen. He expressed himself
in plain terms: He justified compulsory recruitment on the basis
of National Socialist philosophy and on the basis of the necessity
of drawing all the European peoples into the struggle carried on by
Germany. His speech constitutes Document 1739-PS. I submit it
under Exhibit Number RF-10, and I request the Court to take
judicial notice of it and to accept the following passages in evidence
against the Defendant Sauckel. First, Page 5 of the German text,
fourth paragraph—this is found on the first page of the French
translation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The remarkable violence of the war forces me to mobilize,
in the name of the Führer, many millions of foreigners for
labor for the entire German war economy and to urge them to
effect the maximum production. The purpose of this utilization
is to assure in the field of labor the war material necessary in
the struggle for the preservation of the life and liberty, in
the first place, of our own people, and also for the preservation
of our Western culture for those peoples who, in
contrast to the parasitical Jews and plutocrats, possess the
honest will and strength to shape their life by their own
work and effort.</p>
<hr class='tbk453'/>
<p class='noindent'>“This is the vast difference between the work which was
exacted through the Treaty of Versailles and the Dawes and
Young Plans at one time—which took the form of slavery
and tribute to the might and supremacy of Jewry—and the
use of labor which I, as a National Socialist, have the honor
to prepare and to carry out as a contribution by Germany
in the fight for her liberty and for that of her allies.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The compulsory recruitment of foreign workers did not have as
its only object the maintenance of the level of German industrial
<span class='pageno' title='442' id='Page_442'></span>
production. There was also the conscious desire to weaken the
human potential of the occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea of extermination by work was familiar to the theorists
of National Socialism and to the leaders of Germany. It constituted
one of the bases of the policy of domination of the invaded territories.
I lay before the Court the proof that the National Socialist
conspirators envisaged the destruction by work of whole ethnical
groups. A discussion which took place on 14 September 1942
between Goebbels and Thierack is significant. It constitutes Document
682-PS, which I submit to the Tribunal under Exhibit Number
RF-11, from which I take the following passage:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Concerning the extermination of asocial elements, Doctor
Goebbels is of the opinion that the following groups must
be exterminated: All Jews and gypsies; Poles who have to
serve 3 or 4 years penal servitude; Czechoslovakians and
Germans who have been condemned to death or hard labor for
life or placed in protective custody. The idea of extermination
by work is best.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The idea of extermination by work was not applied to ethnical
groups alone, the disappearance of which was desired by the
defendants; it also led to the employment of foreign labor in the
German war industry up to the extreme limit of each man’s
strength. I will revert to this aspect of the policy of forced labor
when I lay before the Tribunal the treatment of foreign workers
in Germany: The cruelty to which they were submitted sprang from
this main conception of National Socialism, that the human forces
of the occupied countries must be employed with no other limitation
than that of their extermination, which is the final goal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defendants have not only admitted the principle of compulsory
recruitment of foreign workers; they have followed a
consistent policy of putting their principle into practice, applying
it in the same concrete manner in the various occupied territories.
To do this they resorted to identical methods of recruitment;
they set up everywhere the same recruitment organizations to
which they gave the same orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first place, it was a question of inducing foreign workers
to work in their own countries for the army of occupation and the
services connected with it. The German military and civil authorities
organized yards and workshops in order to carry out on the
spot work useful to their war policy. The yards and workshops of
the Todt Organization, which were under the direction of the
Defendant Speer after the death of their founder, and those of the
Wehrmacht, Luftwaffe, Kriegsmarine, and the NSKK organization,
employed numerous foreign workers in all areas of Western Europe.
<span class='pageno' title='443' id='Page_443'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>But the essential undertaking of the German labor offices was
the deportation of foreign workers to the munition factories of
the Reich. The most varied means were used to this end. They were
built up into a recruiting policy which can be analyzed as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the beginning, this policy took on the cloak of legality. The
use of labor took the form of requisition as under the terms of
Article 52 of the appendix to the fourth Hague Convention; it was
also effected by means of the voluntary recruitment of workers,
to whom the German recruiting offices offered labor contracts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall provide the Tribunal with proof that the requisitions of
labor effected by the National Socialist authorities were a deliberate
misinterpretation of the letter and spirit of the international
convention by virtue of which they were carried out. I shall show
that the voluntary character of the recruitment of certain foreign
workers was entirely fictitious; in reality their work contracts
were made under the pressure which the occupation authorities
brought to bear on their will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defendants lost no time in flinging aside their mask of
legality. They compelled prisoners of war to do work forbidden by
international conventions. I shall show how the work of prisoners
of war was incorporated in the general plan for the Allocation of
Labor from the occupied areas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all, it is through force that the defendants brought their
recruitment plans to fruition. They did not hesitate to resort to
violent methods. Thus they established compulsory labor service in
the areas which they occupied. Sometimes they directly promulgated
orders bearing the signature of military commanders or Reich
commissioners; this is the case with Belgium and Holland. Sometimes
they forced the actual authorities to take legislative measures
themselves; this is particularly the case with France and Norway.
Sometimes they simply took direct action, that is, they transferred
foreign workers to factories in Germany without issuing regulations
providing for such action; this happened in Denmark. Finally in
certain occupied areas where they had carried out Germanization,
the defendants incorporated the inhabitants of those territories in
the labor service of the Reich. It happened thus in the French provinces
of Haut-Rhin, Bas-Rhin, Moselle, and in Luxembourg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The policy of compulsory labor was asserted and systematized
from the day when the Defendant Sauckel was appointed Plenipotentiary
General for Allocation of Labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Member of the National Socialist Party since its formation,
member of the Diet of Thuringia, and member of the Reichstag,
Obergruppenführer of the criminal organizations SS and SA, the
Defendant Sauckel was Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter of Thuringia.
On 21 March 1942 he was appointed Plenipotentiary General
<span class='pageno' title='444' id='Page_444'></span>
for Allocation of Labor by a decree of the Führer. This decree is
countersigned by Lammers in his capacity as Reichsminister and
Chief of the Chancellery and by the Defendant Keitel; the responsibility
of these latter is confirmed by this countersigning. The
Defendant Keitel has associated himself with the policy of compulsory
labor through the appointment of Sauckel, the principles
and methods of whom he approved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have already read this decree to the Tribunal. I would remind
you that it placed Sauckel, in his capacity as Plenipotentiary General
for Allocation of Labour, under the immediate orders of the
Delegate for the Four Year Plan, the Defendant Göring. The latter
bears a direct responsibility in pursuing the plan of recruitment of
compulsory labor. I shall produce numerous proofs of this. I ask
the Tribunal to authorize me to produce as first proof the decree
signed by the Defendant Göring the day after the appointment of
the Defendant Sauckel. This decree, dated 27 March 1942, was
published in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1942, Part I, Page 180. I submit
it to the Tribunal under Exhibit Number RF-12 (Document Number
1902-PS). Göring by this decree did away with all the administrative
offices of the Four Year Plan which had been charged with the
recruitment of labor; he transmitted their powers to Sauckel’s
department, thus confirming his appointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The powers of Sauckel between 1942 and 1944 were considerably
strengthened by decrees of Hitler and Göring. These decrees gave
full significance to the Defendant Sauckel’s title of Plenipotentiary.
They gave him administrative autonomy and even legislative
competency such as he could not have aspired to had he confined
himself to executive tasks. The importance of the political part
which he played during the last 2 years of the war increases to
this extent the weight of the responsibility devolving upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I draw the attention of the Tribunal very especially to the
decrees of the Führer of 30 September 1942 and of 4 March 1943
and to the decree of the Defendant Göring of 25 May 1942. I will
not read these decrees, which have been commented on by my
American colleague, Mr. Dodd. I submit them in support of my
argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will first refer to the decree of the Defendant Göring of
25 May 1942. It was published in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1942, Part I,
Page 347. He delegated to Sauckel part of the powers relating
to labor held by the Minister of Labor. I submit it to the Tribunal
under Exhibit Number RF-13 (Document Number 1905-PS).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler’s decree of 30 September 1942 gave Sauckel considerable
power over the civil and military authorities of the territories
occupied by the German Armed Forces. It made it possible for the
defendant to introduce into the staffs of the occupying authorities
<span class='pageno' title='445' id='Page_445'></span>
personal representatives to whom he gave his orders direct. The
decree is countersigned by Lammers and by the Defendant Keitel
and appears in the <span class='it'>Collection of the Decrees, Directives, and Notices
of 1942</span>, second volume, Page 510. I submit it under Exhibit Number
RF-14 (Document 1903-PS).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the carrying out of this decree representatives of Sauckel’s
department were in fact introduced into the headquarters staffs
of the military commands. The interrogation of General Von
Falkenhausen, Military Governor of Belgium and Northern France,
gives in this connection a proof which I would ask the Tribunal
to be good enough to remember. General Von Falkenhausen was
interrogated on 27 November 1945 by the head of the Investigation
Section of the French Delegation. I submit his evidence to the
Tribunal under Document Number RF-15. I read the following
extract—Page 3, the first paragraph, of the French text, and
Page 2, the fifth paragraph, of the German translation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Can the witness tell us what was the line of demarcation
between his own powers and the powers of the
Arbeitseinsatz?’</p>
<hr class='tbk454'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘Up to a certain moment there existed in my department
a labor service which was engaged in the hiring of
voluntary workers. I no longer remember the exact date—perhaps
autumn 1942—when this labor service was placed
under the order of Sauckel, and the only thing I had to do
was to carry out the orders which came through this way.
I don’t remember, but Reeder, who is also in prison’ ”—Reeder
was a civilian official on the staff of General Von
Falkenhausen—“ ‘is very well informed about the dates and
can undoubtedly give them better than I can.’</p>
<hr class='tbk455'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Before the question of labor was entirely entrusted to
Sauckel’s organization, did there exist in the General Staff
or in its services an officer who was in charge of this question?
Afterwards was there a delegate from Sauckel’s service in
this department?’</p>
<hr class='tbk456'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘Until Sauckel came into power there was, in my service,
Reeder, who directed the Bureau of Labor in my office. This
labor office functioned as an employment office in Germany,
that is to say, it concerned itself with demands for labor
which would naturally be voluntary.’</p>
<hr class='tbk457'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘What took place when the change happened?’</p>
<hr class='tbk458'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘After the change the office continued to exist, but the
orders were given directly by Sauckel to the Arbeitseinsatz
and passed through my office.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='446' id='Page_446'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. HERZOG: I have just reminded the Tribunal of the legislative
framework through which the activity of the Defendant
Sauckel was exercised. This framework was strengthened by the
varied decrees of the defendant. The first document shows that
Sauckel deliberately assumed the responsibility of the general
policy for the recruitment of foreign workers. It is his decree of
the 22d of August 1942, which appeared in the <span class='it'>Reichsarbeitsblatt</span>,
1942, Part I, Page 382. This decree lays down the principle of
forced recruitment and makes the necessary provisions for the
whole human potential of the occupied territories to be placed at
the service of the German war machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel forced the inhabitants of the invaded countries to participate
in the war of Germany against their own fatherland. It
is not only a violation of international law, it is a crime against
the law of nations. I submit the decree to the Tribunal under
Document Number RF-17 and I shall read it:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Decree Number 10 of the Plenipotentiary General for Allocation
of Labor, concerning the employment of labor in the
occupied territories, under date of 22 August 1942.</p>
<hr class='tbk459'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In order to mobilize the labor force of the occupied territories
under the new organization for the Allocation of
Labor within the European area, this force must be subjected
to a rigid and uniform control. The maximum production,
as well as the useful and rational distribution of this force,
must be assured in order to satisfy the labor requirements of
the Reich and the occupied territories. By virtue of the full
powers which are conferred upon me, I order:</p>
<hr class='tbk460'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1) By virtue of the decree of the Führer, under date of
21 March 1942, concerning the Plenipotentiary General for
Allocation of Labor and by virtue of the ordinance of the
Delegate for the Four Year Plan, under date of 27 March
1942, concerning the application of this decree, I likewise am
competent to employ, as may be necessary, the labor of
occupied territories, as well as to take all the measures
necessary to augment its efficiency. Those German offices
competent for the tasks of the Arbeitseinsatz and for the
policy of wages, or my commissioners, will carry out this
Allocation of Labor and take all measures necessary to
increase efficiency, according to my instructions.</p>
<hr class='tbk461'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2) This decree extends to all the territories occupied during
the war by the Wehrmacht, as far as they are under German
administration.</p>
<hr class='tbk462'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3) The labor available in the occupied territories must be
utilized in the first place to satisfy the primary war needs
of Germany herself.
<span class='pageno' title='447' id='Page_447'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk463'/>
<p class='noindent'>“This labor must be utilized in the occupied territories in the
following order:</p>
<hr class='tbk464'/>
<p class='noindent'>“a) For the needs of the army, the occupation services, and
the civilian services; b) for the needs of German armament;
c) for the tasks of food supply and agriculture; d) for industrial
needs other than those of armament, in which
Germany is interested; e) for the industrial needs concerning
the population of the territory in question.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A second document demonstrates the willingness of the Defendant
Sauckel to take the responsibility for the treatment of foreign
workers. It is an agreement concluded on 2 June 1943 with the
Chief of the German Labor Front. I shall not read this document
to the Tribunal; it has been discussed by Mr. Dodd. I point out
that it was published in the <span class='it'>Reichsarbeitsblatt</span>, 1943, Part I,
Page 588. I submit it in support of my statement under Exhibit
Number RF-18 (Document Number 1913-PS).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Designated by Hitler and by the Defendants Keitel and Göring
in order to pursue, under the control of the latter, the policy of
recruitment of compulsory labor, the Defendant Sauckel carried
out his task by virtue of the responsibilities which he had assumed.
I request that the Tribunal bear this in mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I request the Tribunal, likewise, to note that the policy of
recruitment of foreign workers involves the responsibility of all
German ministers responsible for the economic and social life
of the Reich. An inter-ministerial office, or at any rate an inter-administrative
office, the Central Office for the Four Year Plan,
proceeded to formulate the program for the recruitment of foreign
workers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All departments interested in the labor problem were represented
at the meetings of the Central Office. General Milch
presided at the meetings, in the name of the Defendant Göring.
The Defendant Sauckel and the Defendant Speer took part, in
person, and I shall submit to the Tribunal certain statements made
by them. The Defendant Funk also took part; he therefore knew
of, and approved, the program for the deportation of workers.
He even collaborated in its formulation. As proof thereof I produce
two documents inculpating Funk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first is a letter of 9 February 1944, in which Funk is
summoned to a meeting of the Central Office of the Plan. It is
Document F-674 which I submit to the Tribunal under Exhibit
Number RF-19. I read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Sir: In the name of the Central Office of the Plan, I invite
you to a meeting concerning the question of the Allocation
of Labor, to take place on Wednesday, 16 February 1944,
<span class='pageno' title='448' id='Page_448'></span>
at 10 o’clock in the committee room of the Secretary of
State at the Ministry of Aviation, Leipziger Strasse, in Berlin.</p>
<hr class='tbk465'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In the enclosure I transmit to you some statistics on the
subject of the development of the Allocation of Labor. These
statistics will serve as a basis for discussion at the meeting.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Funk was unable personally to attend the meeting but he
arranged to be represented by Undersecretary of State Hayler.
He received the minutes of the meeting, and on 7 March 1944 he
wrote to General Milch to excuse himself for his frequent absences
from the meetings of the Office. I submit this document to the
Tribunal. It is Document F-675, which I submit under Exhibit
Number RF-20. It is the account of the 53rd meeting of the Central
Office of the Plan. The Tribunal may see on Page 2 of the French
translation that Minister Funk received an account of this meeting.
He is mentioned on the second line of the distribution list—Reich
Minister Speer first and on the second line Reich Minister
Funk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now produce under Exhibit Number RF-21 (Document Number
F-676) the letter by which Funk excuses himself to Marshal Milch
because of his inability to be present at the meetings:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Very honored and dear Field Marshal:</p>
<hr class='tbk466'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Unfortunately the meetings of the Central Office of the Plan
are always set for dates when I am already engaged by
other important meetings. So it is to my great regret that
I shall be unable to be present Saturday at the meeting of
the Central Office of the Plan, inasmuch as I have to speak
on that day in Vienna in the course of a great demonstration
commemorating the anniversary of the day of the Anschluss.</p>
<hr class='tbk467'/>
<p class='noindent'>“State Secretary Dr. Hayler will also be in Vienna on Friday
and Saturday, where at the same time there will be an
important southeast European conference, in which foreign
delegates will participate and at which I must likewise speak.</p>
<hr class='tbk468'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Under these circumstances I beg you to allow Ministerial
Director and General of Police, SS Brigadeführer Ohlendorf,
who is the permanent deputy of State Secretary Hayler,
to participate as my representative.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does this document tell us anything more
than that the Defendant Funk was unable to be present?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. HERZOG: This document, Mr. President, was given to me
by my American colleagues, who asked me to use it in the matter
of compulsory labor, because they have not had the necessary
time to include it in their charge against Funk. It is presented
to the Tribunal to prove that Funk followed the meetings of
<span class='pageno' title='449' id='Page_449'></span>
the Central Office of the Plan and that he had permanent representatives
there. He was represented at all meetings, and by the
minutes he received he was kept in touch with the work of the
Central Office of the Plan. That is why we present to the
Tribunal this document on Defendant Funk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall continue to quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Under these circumstances, I beg you to allow Ministerial
Director and General of Police, SS Brigadeführer Ohlendorf,
who is the permanent deputy of State Secretary Hayler, to
participate as my representative. Mr. Ohlendorf will have
Ministerial Director Dr. Koelfen as a consultant for questions
concerning goods for consumption and Counsellor of State
Dr. Janke, for questions concerning foreign trade.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The policy of the Central Office pursued by the Defendant
Sauckel is shown by the mass deportation of workers. The principle
of this deportation is a criminal one, but the manner of its execution
was even more criminal. I shall submit proof of this to the
Tribunal and explain in succession, the methods of compulsory
recruitment, its results, and the conditions of deportation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish here to thank the members of the French Delegation
and of the foreign delegations who have come to my aid in the
preparation of my work, in particular, my colleague M. Pierre
Portal, attorney at the bar of Lyons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The statement which I have the honor of presenting to the
Tribunal will be limited to the account of the recruiting of foreign
labor in the occupied territories of Western Europe, since the
deportation of workers coming from Eastern Europe will be dealt
with by my Soviet colleagues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the whole duration of the occupation the local field
commanders imposed conscription of labor on the populations of
the occupied territories. Fortification works considered necessary
for the furtherance of military operations and guard duties made
necessary by the need of maintaining the security of the occupation
troops were carried out by the inhabitants of the occupied areas.
The labor requisitions affected not only isolated individuals but
entire groups.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In France, for instance, they affected, in turn, groups of Indo-Chinese
workers, workers from North Africa, foreign workers,
and <span class='it'>Chantiers de Jeunesse</span> (youth workyards). I produce in evidence
an extract from the report on forced labor and the deportation
of workers drawn up by the Institute of Statistics of the
French Government. This report bears the Document Number
F-515 and I submit it to the Tribunal under Exhibit Number
RF-22. This document, because of its importance, has been taken
out of the document book. I quote first of all Page 17 of the French
<span class='pageno' title='450' id='Page_450'></span>
text and 17, likewise, of the German translation, second paragraph
before the end:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Paragraph 6: The forced labor recruitment of constituted
groups:</p>
<hr class='tbk469'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Finally, a last procedure employed by the Germans on a
number of occasions during the whole course of the occupation,
for direct forced labor as well as for indirect forced
labor: the ‘requisition’ of constituted groups already trained
and disciplined and consequently an excellent contribution.</p>
<hr class='tbk470'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(a) Indo-Chinese labor (M.O.I.): This formation of colonial
workers had been intended from the beginning of hostilities
to satisfy the needs of French industry in unskilled labor.
Under the control of officers and noncommissioned officers
of the French Army, who became civilian officials after the
month of July 1940, Indo-Chinese labor was, from 1945 on,
compelled to do partial forced labor, directly as well as
indirectly.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I skip the table on Page 18 and I read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“(b) North African labor: Between 17 August and 6 November
1942 the home country received two contingents of workers
from North Africa; one composed of 5,560 Algerians, the
other of 1,825 Moroccans. These workers were immediately
compelled to do direct forced labor, which brought the
number of North African workers enrolled in the Todt
Organization to 17,582.</p>
<hr class='tbk471'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(c) Foreign labor: The law of 11 July 1938, concerning
the organization of the nation in time of war, provided
for the cases of foreigners living in France, obliging them
to render service. Under French officers and noncommissioned
officers who by the law of 9 October 1940 had
assumed the status of civil servants, foreign labor was progressively
subjected by the Germans to direct forced labor.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I skip the table and I read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“(d) Youth workyards: On 29 January 1943 the labor staff
of the German Armistice Commission in Paris made known
that the Commander-in-Chief ‘West’ was examining whether
and in what ways the formations of French labor might be
called upon for the accomplishment of tasks important for
both countries. There followed partial recruiting and demands
for young people from the workyards for direct labor.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Similar requisitions took place in all the other territories of
Western Europe. These requisitions were illegal. They were
carried out by virtue of Article 52 of the Appendix to the fourth
Hague Convention. In reality they systematically violated the
letter and the spirit of the text of this international law.
<span class='pageno' title='451' id='Page_451'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>What does Article 52 of the Appendix to the fourth Hague
Convention say? It is worded as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Requisitions in kind and services shall not be demanded
from municipalities or inhabitants except for the needs of
the army of occupation. They shall be in proportion to
the resources of the country and be of such a nature that
they do not imply for the populations the obligation to
take part in war operations against their country. Such
requisitions and services shall be demanded only on the
authority of the commander of the area occupied.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The terms in which Article 52 authorizes the requisition of
services by an army of occupation are expressly formulated. These
terms are four in number:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. The rendering of services can be demanded only for the
needs of the army of occupation. All requisitions made for the
general economic needs of the occupying power are thus forbidden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. Services demanded by way of requisition must not entail
an obligation to take part in military operations against the
country of those rendering them. The rendering of any service
exacted in the interests of the war economy of the occupying
power, all guard duties, or exercise of military control are forbidden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. Services rendered in a given area must be in proportion
to its economic resources, the development of which must not be
hampered. It follows that any requisitioning of labor is contrary
to international law if it results in the impeding or prevention
of the normal utilization of the riches of the occupied country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. Finally, labor requisitions must, under the provisions of the
second paragraph of Article 52, be carried out in the area of the
locality under the administration of the occupation authority who
has signed the requisition order. The transfer of conscripted workers
from one part of the occupied area to another and, even more, their
deportation to the country of the occupied power, are prohibited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Labor requisitions exacted by German civilian and military
authorities in the occupied areas did not honor the spirit of Article 52.
They were carried out to satisfy either the needs of German
economy or even the needs of the military strategy of the enemy
forces. They deliberately refused to acknowledge the need of
ensuring facilities for a reasonable utilization of local resources.
They finally took the form of migration of workers. The case of
those workers who were conscripted from all countries of Western
Europe and formed an integral part of the Todt Organization, to
help in building the system of fortifications known under the name
of the “Atlantic Wall,” may be taken as a typical example.
<span class='pageno' title='452' id='Page_452'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This violation of international agreements is a flagrant one; it
called forth repeated protests from General Doyen, Delegate of the
French authorities at the German Armistice Commission. I ask the
Tribunal to accept as evidence the letter of General Doyen, dated
25 May 1941. This letter constitutes Document F-283 and it is
placed before the Tribunal as Exhibit Number RF-23, I read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Wiesbaden, 25 May 1941. Général de Corps d’Armée Doyen,
President of the French Delegation at the German Armistice
Commission, to General of Artillery Vogl, President of the
German Armistice Commission.</p>
<hr class='tbk472'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On several occasions, and notably in my letters Numbers
14,263/A&nbsp;E and 14,887/A&nbsp;E of 26 February and 8 March, I
protested to you against the use made of French labor within
the Todt Organization in the execution of military work on
the coast of Brittany.</p>
<hr class='tbk473'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I have today the duty of calling your attention to other cases
in which the occupation authorities have had recourse to
recruiting French civilians to carry out services of a strictly
military character, cases which are even more grave than
those which I have already called to your attention.</p>
<hr class='tbk474'/>
<p class='noindent'>“If, indeed, as concerns the workers engaged by the Todt
Organization, it may be argued that certain ones among them
accepted voluntarily an employment for which they are being
remunerated (although in practice most often they were not
given the possibility of refusing this employment), this
argument can by no means be invoked when the prefects
themselves are obliged at the expense of the departments and
the communities, to set up guard services at important points,
such as bridges, tunnels, works of art, telephone lines, munitions
depots, and areas surrounding aviation fields.</p>
<hr class='tbk475'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The accompanying note furnishes some examples of the
guard services which have thus been imposed upon Frenchmen,
services which before this were assumed by the
German Army and which normally fall to the latter, since it
is a question of participating in watches or of preserving the
German Army from risks arising from the state of war
existing between Germany and Great Britain.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The occupying authorities, in the face of the resistance which
they encountered, were anxious that their orders regarding the
requisition of labor should be obeyed. The measures which they
took to this end are just as illegal as the measures taken for the
requisition itself. The National Socialist authorities in occupied
France proceeded by way of legislation. They promulgated ordinances
by which sentence of death could be pronounced against
persons disobeying requisition orders.
<span class='pageno' title='453' id='Page_453'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit two of these ordinances to the Tribunal as evidence.
The first was given in the early months of the occupation, 10
October 1940. It was published in the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> for the
occupied territory of France on 17 October 1940, Page 108. I submit
it to the Tribunal under Document Number RF-24, and I read it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Ordinance concerning protection against acts of sabotage,
10 October 1940.</p>
<hr class='tbk476'/>
<p class='noindent'>“By virtue of the powers which have been conferred upon
me by the Führer and Supreme Commander of the Armed
Forces, I decree the following:</p>
<hr class='tbk477'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I. Whoever intentionally does not fulfill or fulfills inadequately
the tasks of surveillance which are imposed upon him
by the Chief of the Military Administration in France, or by
an authority designated by the latter, shall be condemned to
death.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I skip Paragraph 2 and read Paragraph 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In less serious cases concerning infractions of Paragraphs 1
and 2 of the present ordinance, and in case of negligence,
punishment by solitary confinement with hard labor or
imprisonment may be imposed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The second ordinance of the Military Commander in France to
which I refer is dated 31 January 1942. It was published in the
<span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> of France of 3 February 1942, Page 338. I submit
it to the Tribunal under Document Number RF-25 and I read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Ordinance of 31 January 1942 concerning the requisition of
service and goods.</p>
<hr class='tbk478'/>
<p class='noindent'>“By virtue of the plenary powers which have been conferred
on me by the Führer and Supreme Commander of the Armed
Forces, I decree the following:</p>
<hr class='tbk479'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. Whoever fails to comply with these requisitions of service
or goods which are imposed upon him by the Military
Commander in France, or an authority designated by him,
or who performs them in such a manner as to imperil or
make fail the purpose of the services or requisitions, shall
be punished by penal servitude, imprisonment, or fine. A fine
may be imposed in addition to penal servitude or imprisonment.</p>
<hr class='tbk480'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. In serious cases the penalty of death may be inflicted.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These ordinances were protested against by the French authorities.
General Doyen protested on several occasions against the
first of these without his protest having any effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I refer again to his letter of 25 May 1941, which I have just
submitted to the Tribunal under Exhibit Number RF-23 (Document
<span class='pageno' title='454' id='Page_454'></span>
Number F-283), and I read on Page 3 of the French text, Page 4 of
the German translation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I am instructed to lodge a formal protest with you against
such practices and to beg you to intervene so that an immediate
end may be put to this.</p>
<hr class='tbk481'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On 16 November, in letter Number 7,843/AE, I already
protested against the ordinance that was decreed on 10
October 1940, by the Chief of the Military Administration in
France, which provided the death penalty for any person
failing to carry out or carrying out inadequately the tasks
of surveillance imposed by the occupation authorities. I
protested then that this demand, as well as the penalty, was
contrary to the spirit of the Armistice Convention, the object
of which was to relieve the French population from any
participation in the hostilities.</p>
<hr class='tbk482'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I had limited myself to this protest in principle because at
the time no concrete case in which such a task of surveillance
might have been imposed had been called to my attention.
But it was not possible to accept as justification of the
ordinance in question the arguments which you gave me in
your letter Number 1361 of 6 March.</p>
<hr class='tbk483'/>
<p class='noindent'>“You did indeed point out there that Article 43 of the
Hague Convention gave the occupying power the authority to
legislate, but the power to which you refer in the said article
is subject to two qualifications: There can be legislation only
to establish and secure public order and life as far as it is
possible. On the other hand, the ordinances decreed must.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Isn’t it enough to show that General Doyen
protested? It is not necessary to read all the argument which was
put forward on the one side or the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. HERZOG: I shall then stop this quotation, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German ordinances which I have just read to the Tribunal
thus contained formal violations of the general principles of international
criminal legislation; they were decreed in contradiction
to Article 52 of the Annex to the fourth convention of The Hague
and also in contradiction to Article 43, on which they were supposed
to be based. They were, therefore, illegal and they were criminal,
since they provided death sentences which no international law or
domestic law justifies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The system of the requisition of service furnishes the first
example of the criminal character of the methods pursued by the
defendants in the execution of their plan of recruitment of foreign
labor.
<span class='pageno' title='455' id='Page_455'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The National Socialist authorities then had recourse to a second
procedure to give an appearance of legality to the recruiting of
foreign workers. They called upon workers who were so-called
volunteers. From 1940 on, the occupation authorities opened
recruiting offices in all the large cities of the occupied territories.
These offices were placed under the control of a special service
instituted for this purpose within the general staff of the commanders-in-chief
of occupation zones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal knows that these services from 1940 to 1942
functioned under the control of the generals. From 1942 on, and
more precisely, from the day when the Defendant Sauckel became
the Plenipotentiary for Allocation of Labor, they received their
orders directly from the latter. General Von Falkenhausen, Commander-in-Chief
in Belgium and in the north of France, declared
in the testimony which I have just read to the Tribunal that from
the summer of 1942 he had become the simple intermediary charged
with transmitting the instructions given by Sauckel to the Arbeitseinsatz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, the policy of the German employment offices set up in
the occupied areas was carried out from 1942 under the sole
responsibility of the Defendant Sauckel and his direct chief, the
Delegate for the Four Year Plan, the Defendant Göring. I ask
the Tribunal to take note of this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The task of the employment offices was to organize the recruiting
of workers for the factories and workshops set up in Europe
by the Todt Organization and by the Wehrmacht, Kriegsmarine,
Luftwaffe, and other German organizations. It was also their task
to procure for the German munition factories the amount of foreign
labor needed. Workers recruited in this way signed a labor contract;
thus they had, theoretically, the status of free workers and were
apparently volunteers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The occupation authorities always made a point of the voluntary
nature of the recruiting carried out by the employment offices, but
the line followed by their propaganda systematically ignored what
they were actually doing. In fact, the voluntary character of this
recruiting was entirely fictitious; the workers of the occupied areas
who agreed to sign German labor contracts were subject to physical
and moral pressure. This pressure took several forms. It was
sometimes collective and sometimes individual. In all its forms it
was heavy enough to deprive the workers, who were its victims,
of their freedom of choice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nullity of contracts entered into under the sway of violence
is a fundamental principle of law common to all civilized nations.
It is found just as expressly stated in German law as in the laws of
the powers represented in the Court, or the states occupied by
<span class='pageno' title='456' id='Page_456'></span>
Germany. The German employment offices forced on the foreign
workers labor contracts which had no legal significance because
they were obtained with violence. I assert this and I will try to
provide the Court with proof of my assertion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First of all, I will show proof of premeditation by the Germans.
The pressure under which the foreign workers suffered was not the
result of sporadic action on the part of subordinate authorities. It
came from the deliberate intent which the National Socialist leaders
of Germany formulated into precise instructions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit to the Tribunal Document 1183-PS, which is Exhibit
Number RF-26. This is a circular dated 29 January 1942, dealing
with the recruitment of foreign workers. This directive comes
from a section of the Arbeitseinsatz of the Delegate for the Four
Year Plan. It bears the signature of the section chief, Dr. Mansfeld,
but it places the executive responsibility directly on the Defendant
Göring, Delegate for the Four Year Plan. I read this circular:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

for the Wehrmacht and on the other hand by the increased
amount of work for armaments in the Reich, renders it
necessary for labor for service in the Reich to be recruited
from the occupied territories to a much greater extent than
heretofore, in order to relieve the shortage.</p>
<hr class='tbk486'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Therefore, any and all methods must be adopted which make
it possible to transport, without exception and at once, for
employment in the Reich, manpower in the occupied territories
which is unemployed or which can be released .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for
use in Germany after most careful screening.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I read further on Page 2 of the German text:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the first place, this mobilization shall be carried out on
a voluntary basis as hitherto. For this reason recruitment for
employment in the German Reich must be intensified considerably.
If, however, satisfactory results are to be obtained,
the German authorities who are operating in the occupied
territories must be able to exert any pressure necessary to
support the voluntary recruitment of labor for employment
in Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk487'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Accordingly, as far as may be necessary, the regulations
in force in the occupied territories with regard to changing
the place of employment or .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. those refusing work, must be
tightened. Supplementary regulations concerning distribution
of labor must, above all, insure that older persons who are
<span class='pageno' title='457' id='Page_457'></span>
exempt will be used to replace younger persons so that the
latter may be made available for the Reich. A far-reaching
reduction in the amount of relief granted by public welfare
must also be effected in order to induce laborers to accept
employment in the Reich. Unemployment relief must be set
so low that the amount, in comparison with the average
wages in the Reich and the possibilities there for sending
remittances home, may serve as an inducement to the workers
to accept employment in Germany. When refusal to accept
work in the Reich is not justified, relief must be reduced to
an amount barely sufficient for subsistence or even cancelled.
In this case partial withdrawal of ration cards and an
assignment to particularly heavy compulsory work may be
considered.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I here end the quotation and I call to the Tribunal’s attention
that this circular is addressed to all the services responsible for
labor in the occupied areas. Its distribution in Western Europe
was: The Reich Commissioner for the occupied Norwegian territories,
the Reich Commissioner for the occupied Dutch territories,
the Chief of the Military Administration of Belgium and Northern
France, the Chief of the Military Administration of France, the
Chief of the Civil Administration of Luxembourg, the Chief of
the Civil Administration at Metz, and the Chief of the Civil
Administration at Strasbourg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is thus proved that a general common plan existed with a
view to compelling the workers of the occupied territories to work
for Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have now to show how this plan was put into practice in the
different occupation zones. The machinery of pressure which the
National Socialist authorities exerted on the foreign workers can
be analyzed in the following manner: German labor offices organized
intense propaganda in favor of the recruitment of foreign workers.
This propaganda was intended to deceive the workers of the
occupied areas with regard to the material advantages offered
them by the German employment offices. It was carried out by the
press, the radio, and by every possible means of publicity. This
propaganda was also carried on as a side-line to official administrative
duties by secret organizations which had been given the
task of enticing foreign workers and subjecting them to a veritable
impressment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These measures proved to be insufficient. The occupation
authorities then intervened in the social life of the occupied
countries. They strove to produce artificial unemployment there and
at the same time they devoted their energies to making living
conditions worse for the workers and the unemployed.
<span class='pageno' title='458' id='Page_458'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of unemployment and the poverty with which they were
threatened, the foreign workers showed themselves unmoved by
German propaganda. This is why the German authorities finally
resorted to direct methods of pressure. They exercised pressure on
the political authorities of the occupied countries to make them
give support to the recruiting campaign. They compelled employers,
especially the organizational committees in France, to induce their
workers to accept the labor contracts of the German employment
offices. Finally, they took action by way of direct pressure on the
workers and gradually passed from so-called voluntary recruitment
to conscription by force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fiction of voluntary enrollment was dispelled by the sight
of the individual arrests and collective raids of which the workers
of the occupied areas rapidly became the victims. There are
innumerable documents providing proof of the facts which I relate.
I shall submit the most important of these to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The documents which show proof of the publicity campaigns
made in France by the German administration will be submitted to
the Tribunal by M. Edgar Faure in the course of his brief concerning
Germanization and Nazification. By way of example I wish to
make use of a document which in the French classification bears the
Document Number F-516, which I submit under Exhibit Number
RF-27.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is a report of the Prefect of the Department of the North
to the Delegate of the Minister of the Interior in the General
Delegation of the French Government in the Occupied Territories.
This report points out that a German publicity car circulated through
the community of Lille in order to induce French workers to go to
Germany. I quote the report:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Lille, 25 March 1942. Prefect of the Region of the North,
Prefect of the Lille Region, to the Prefect, Delegate of the

<p class='noindent'>“I have the honor to inform you that for some days a

the ‘Marche Lorraine’ and the hymn ‘Maréchal, Here We

<h2><span class='pageno' title='459' id='Page_459'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>M. HERZOG: Mr. President, Your Honors. I showed you this
morning what the official propaganda was which was conducted by
the German offices in France to persuade workers to enroll for
work in Germany. The effect of this official propaganda was reinforced
by the clandestine recruitment bureaus. Real dens for
clandestine recruiting were organized by the occupation authorities
apart from the administrative services whose activities they
completed. These recruitment bureaus were directed by German
agents who often succeeded in securing local accomplices. In France
these bureaus extended their ramifications to the non-occupied zone
as well as the occupied zone. Several documents prove their
existence. The first among them is a report transmitted on 7 March
1942 by the Vice President of the Council of Ministers of the
<span class='it'>de facto</span> Government of Vichy, to the Delegate General for Franco-German
Economic Relations. It is Document F-654 of the French
archives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This report is drawn up under the seal of Vice President of the
Council, Darlan. It bears the signature of an officer of the latter’s
General Staff, Commander Fontaine. I submit this report under
Exhibit Number RF-28 (Document F-654) and I read it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Vichy, 7 March 1942. Your Honor, the Delegate General,
I have the honor of transmitting to you in this letter, for your
information, a report on the organization of recruitment in
France of workers for German industry.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now go to Page 2.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“26 of February 1942. Secret. Note on the organization of
the recruitment in France of workers for German industry.
Source: excellent.</p>
<hr class='tbk490'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I. Organization of the recruitment of workers in France.</p>
<hr class='tbk491'/>
<p class='noindent'>“One of the main organizations for the recruitment of workers
in France for Germany is to be Société de Mécanique de la
Seine, whose head office is in Puteaux, Seine, at 8 Quai
National, and which is also known as A. M. S.</p>
<hr class='tbk492'/>
<p class='noindent'>“This society is to operate under the secret control of the
Kommandantur, and of three engineers, one of which is to
have the rank of chief engineer and the other two are to be
M. Meyer and M. Schronner.</p>
<hr class='tbk493'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In addition to the work which it has to carry out, this
society is particularly entrusted with the re-education of
workers recruited in France and sent to Germany at the
request of German industrial firms on payment of premiums.
<span class='pageno' title='460' id='Page_460'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk494'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The A. M. S. is assisted in these operations in the Occupied
Zone by three centers of recruiting which operate in Paris
and are the Porte de Vincennes Center, the Courbevoie
Center (200 Boulevard St. Denis), and the Avenue des Tournelles
Center. These centers are also charged with co-ordinating
the operations of recruitment in the non-occupied zone.
For this zone, the two principal centers are in Marseilles and
Toulouse. A third center is to be at Tarbes.</p>
<hr class='tbk495'/>
<p class='noindent'>“a) The center at Marseilles is in charge of the recruitment
in the Mediterranean zone, under the direction of Mr. Meyer
who is mentioned above. The address of this engineer is not
known, but one can obtain information about him at
24 Avenue Kléber, Paris, at the Military Commander’s.</p>
<hr class='tbk496'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In Marseilles the A. M. S. office is situated at 83 Rue de
Sylvabelle. In his task Mr. Meyer is assisted by M. Ringo,
who lives in Madrague-Ville, 5 bis Boulevard Bernabo, near
the slaughter house.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I stop this quotation here to submit to the Tribunal the
correspondence exchanged between the months of December 1941
and January 1942, between the Prefect of the Alpes-Maritimes and
the authorities of the Vichy Government. This is Document F-518
which I submit to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number RF-29. This
correspondence emphasizes the activity of the German agents in
clandestine recruiting, and particularly that of Mr. Meyer, to whom
the report of Commander Fontaine, which I have just read, applies.
I quote first the letter of 10 December 1941, in which the Prefect of
the Alpes-Maritimes confirmed the reports which he had previously
made on this question. It is the letter which is on the sixth page
of the French text and the seventh page of the German text:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Nice, 10 December 1941. The State Counsellor, Prefect of
the Alpes-Maritimes, to His Honor, the State Secretary of

<p class='noindent'>“Reference: Your telegrams 12,402 and 12,426 of 28 November

<hr class='tbk499'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In my reports referred to I pointed out to you the activity
of recruiting agents who attempted to entice skilled workers
on behalf of Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk500'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I have the honor of giving you below some additional
information gathered on this subject.
<span class='pageno' title='461' id='Page_461'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk501'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The German engineer Meyer and the French subject Bentz
stopped on 1 December 1941 at the Hotel Splendid in Nice,
coming from Marseilles.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I go on to the third paragraph before the end:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I permit myself to draw your attention particularly to the
fact that in Paris they enrolled French workers for Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here I end the quotation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These documents attest to the activity which the clandestine
recruiting offices developed. But I am not satisfied merely to point
out their existence; I wish to show that these offices operated
under the initiative of official administrations and of the German
office for labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proof is furnished by a statement which the Defendant
Sauckel made on 1 March 1944, during the 54th conference of the
Central Office for the Four Year Plan. The stenographic report of
these conferences has been found. It forms Document R-124, to
which my American colleagues have already referred. I submit it
again to the Tribunal under Exhibit Number RF-30 and I shall
read from an extract of the minutes of the session of 1 March 1944.
This is in Exhibit Number RF-30, in the French text, Page 2, second
paragraph; in the German text, Pages 1770 and 1771. I quote the
page numbers which are at the bottom and on the right of the
German original. I read the declaration made by the Defendant
Sauckel:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The most abominable point against which I have to fight is
the claim that there is no organization in these districts
properly to recruit Frenchmen, Belgians, and Italians and to
dispatch them to work. So I have even proceeded to employ
and train a whole staff of French and Italian agents of both
sexes who for good pay, just as was done in olden times for
‘shanghaiing,’ go hunting for men and dupe them, using
liquor as well as persuasion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The propaganda of the official services and that of the clandestine
recruiting offices proved to be inefficacious. The National
Socialist authorities then had to resort to methods of economic
pressure. They tried to give to the workers who were to go to
Germany the hope of material advantages. I cite in respect to this
an ordinance of the Military Commander in Belgium and the North
of France, which I submit to the Tribunal. It is an ordinance of
20 July 1942 which appeared in the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> of Belgium.
It exempts from tax Belgian workers who work in German
factories. I submit it to the Tribunal under Document Number RF-31.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, the occupation authorities sought to lower
the living standard of workers who remained in the occupied
<span class='pageno' title='462' id='Page_462'></span>
territories. I said that they had made poverty a factor in their
recruiting policy. I am going to prove it by showing how they
went about creating artificial unemployment in the occupied zones
and aggravating the material situation of the unemployed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remark as a reminder that the German authorities also
practiced for this purpose a policy of freezing salaries. This
measure aided the recruiting campaign for labor for Germany and
had also an economic bearing, and I would like to refer the
Tribunal to the explanations which will be given on this point by
M. Gerthoffer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unemployment was produced by two complementary measures:
The first is the regulating of the legal working hours; the second,
the concentration and, if need be, the closing of industrial
enterprises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From 1940 the local field commandants were concerned with
increasing the duration of work in their administrative zones. In
France steps taken by the local authorities brought about reactions.
The problem became general and was solved on a national scale.
Long negotiations were imposed on the representatives of the
pseudo-government of Vichy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally an ordinance of 22 April 1942, from the Military
Command in France, reserved for the occupation authorities the
right of fixing the duration of work in industrial enterprises. This
ordinance appeared in their <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt Frankreich</span>, 1942.
I submit it to the Tribunal under Document Number RF-32 and I
quote the first paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Paragraph I: For establishments and enterprises of all kinds
a minimum of working hours may be imposed. This minimum
of working hours will be decreed for an entire economic
region, for specified economic branches, or for individual
enterprises.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In Belgium working hours were fixed by a decree and by an
implementing order of 6 October 1942, which appeared in the
<span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> of Belgium. I submit this ordinance to the
Tribunal under Document Number RF-33.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The regulating of working hours did not release a sufficient
number of workers for the German factories; that is why the
National Socialist authorities used a second method. Under the
pretext of rationalizing production they brought about a concentration
of industrial and commercial enterprises, certain of which
were closed at their instigation. I cite in this relation the provisions
which were made or imposed by the Germans in France, in
Belgium, and in Holland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In France I would like to refer to two texts. The first is the
ordinance of the Vichy Government of 17 December 1941, published
<span class='pageno' title='463' id='Page_463'></span>
in the <span class='it'>Journal Officiel de L’État Français</span>, which I submit to the
Tribunal under Document Number RF-34. The second text to
which I wish to draw the attention of the Tribunal is the ordinance
of 25 February 1942, issued by the Military Commandant in France.
This ordinance appeared in the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt des Militärbefehlshabers
in Frankreich</span>. I shall read it to the Tribunal because
it seems particularly important, as the principle for the compulsory
closing of certain French enterprises is laid down by a decree by
the occupying power. I shall read the first and second paragraphs
of Document Number RF-35:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Paragraph I: If the economic situation, especially as regards
the use of raw materials and industrial appliances, requires
it, establishments and economic enterprises may be partly or
completely closed.</p>
<hr class='tbk502'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Paragraph II: The closing of these enterprises will be
announced by field headquarters by means of a written
notification addressed to the establishment or to the industrial
enterprise.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In Belgium I refer to the ordinances of the Military Commandant,
30 March and 3 October 1942, which appeared in the
<span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> in Belgium. I submit to the Tribunal the ordinance
of 30 March under Document Number RF-36.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Holland the regulating provisions of the occupying authorities
were more stringent than elsewhere. I present an ordinance
of the Reich Commissioner for the territory of occupied Holland,
15 March 1943. I submit it to the Tribunal under Document
Number RF-37.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This ordinance presents a double interest. First, it offers
precise information which emphasizes the method with which the
German services executed their recruiting plan. It constitutes, on
the other hand, the first document I shall submit to the Tribunal
accusing the Defendant Seyss-Inquart. The policy of Sauckel was
carried out in Holland with the collaboration of Reich Commissioner
Seyss-Inquart. The ordinances regarding compulsory labor in
Holland were all issued on the responsibility of Seyss-Inquart,
whether they bear his actual signature or not. I ask the Tribunal
to note this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The increase of the legal working hours and the closing of
industrial enterprises deprived thousands of workers of their jobs.
The defendants did not hesitate to use material constraint to incite
the unemployed to work for Germany. They threatened the
unemployed that they would do away with their unemployment
compensation. This threat was made on several occasions by the
local field commandants in occupied France. I find proof in the
protest made by the French authorities to the German Armistice
<span class='pageno' title='464' id='Page_464'></span>
Commission. The French document is F-282, which I submit to the
Tribunal under Exhibit Number RF-38. I read the first page, third
paragraph of the letter:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Moreover, the occupation authorities stipulate that the
workers who refuse the work offered to them will forfeit
their right to unemployment compensation and may be
prosecuted by the war tribunal for sabotage of Franco-German
collaboration.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Far from disavowing the initiative of their local authorities, the
Central Office for Labor gave them instructions to continue this
policy. The proof is furnished by the circular of Dr. Mansfeld,
dated 29 January 1942, which I have just submitted to the Tribunal
under Exhibit Number RF-26 (Document Number 1183-PS) in which
instructions were given that the stopping of unemployment compensation
should be utilized as a means of pressure on workers from
foreign countries. The circular of Dr. Mansfeld shows that the
blackmail of the National Socialist leaders was practiced not only
in the granting of unemployment compensation, but also in the
issuing of ration cards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, the defendants tried to force the inhabitants of the
occupied territories to leave for Germany by increasing their food
difficulties. The proof of this intention is given in the report of the
session of 1 March 1944 of the Conference of the Four Year Plan.
This document I referred to a short time ago as Exhibit Number
RF-30 (Document R-124). This is a passage which has not yet been
read, which the Tribunal will please permit me to read. It is on
Page 5 of the French translation, Pages 1814 and 1815 of the
German text. The page numbers are at the bottom and on the
right. I read on the top of Page 5 of the French text:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Milch: ‘Wouldn’t the following method be better than .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
to protect the “S” factories, German administration should
take over the feeding of the Italians and say to them, “No
one shall receive food unless he works in a protected factory
(S-Betrieb) or leaves for Germany?’ ”</p>
<hr class='tbk503'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Sauckel: ‘It is true that the French workman in France is
better fed than the German workman in Germany. The
Italian workman, even if he does not work at all, is better
fed in the part of Italy which we occupy than if he worked
in Germany.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I have shown the Tribunal the economic and social measures
which the National Socialist authorities took to force workers in
the occupied territories to accept labor contracts offered by the
German authorities. This indirect coercion was reinforced by direct
pressure which was simultaneously put on the local governments,
the employers, and on the workers themselves.
<span class='pageno' title='465' id='Page_465'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The National Socialist leaders knew that their recruiting policy
could be facilitated by the local authorities. That is why they tried
to make the pseudo-governments of the occupied territories
guarantee or indorse the fiction of voluntary enrollment. I submit
to the Tribunal an example of the pressure which the German
services placed on the Vichy Government to that purpose. They
first arranged that the State Secretariat of Labor should issue a
circular to all prefects on 29 March 1941. The German authorities
were not satisfied with this circular. They were conscious of the
illegality of their recruiting methods and they wished to justify
them by an agreement with the <span class='it'>de facto</span> government of France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They required that this agreement be made known by public
statement. Negotiations were carried out for this purpose in 1941
and 1942. The violence of the German pressure is substantiated
by the letters addressed by Dr. Michel, chief of the administrative
staff, to the Delegate General for Franco-German Economic
Relations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I refer especially to his letters of 3 March 1942 and 15 May
1942, which constitute Exhibits Numbers RF-39 and 40 (Documents
Numbers F-526 and F-525). I read first to the Tribunal the letter
of 15 May, which is under Exhibit Number RF-39 (Document
Number F-526):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Paris, 15 May 1942.</p>
<hr class='tbk504'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Subject: The Recruiting of French Labor for Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk505'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As the result of the conversations of 24 January 1942, and
after repeated appeals, the first draft of the declaration of
the French Government concerning recruiting was presented
27 February. On the German side it was accepted with slight
modifications and in written form on 3 March, on the condition
that at the time of its transmission to the organizational
committees, attention should be directed to the fact
that the French Government expressly approved of the
acceptance of work in Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk506'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On 19 March attention was drawn to the fact that a draft
for a memorandum to the organizational committees should
be submitted, whereupon the draft was submitted on
27 March. On 30 March a proposal for modification was
delivered to M. Terray, who was to take it up with
M. Bichelonne.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I skip the two following paragraphs, and I will read the last
paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Although no reason appears for the unusual and incomprehensible
delay, the draft has not been presented up to
now. As more than 2 months have passed since the first
<span class='pageno' title='466' id='Page_466'></span>
request for the submission of the memorandum, it is
requested that the new draft be submitted by 19 May.</p>
<hr class='tbk507'/>
<p class='noindent'>“For the Military Commandant; for Chief of the Administrative
Staff. Signed, Dr. Michel.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal undoubtedly has observed that Dr. Michel
demanded not only the circulation of a public declaration, but also
insisted that the text of this statement be officially transmitted to
the organizational committees. The pressure which occupation
authorities put upon French industrial enterprises to stimulate
them to encourage the departure of their workers to Germany was
brought about, in fact, through the medium of the organizational
committees. The German offices for labor collaborated directly
with the organizational committees. They ordered conferences in
the course of which they dictated their will to the leaders of these
committees. They also insisted that the organizational committees
should be informed of all the measures which the French authorities
had to take.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The committees could then be associated with these measures
in the interests of German policy. The correspondence of Dr. Michel
offers numerous examples of the constant efforts of the German
authorities to act upon the organizational committees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have just offered an example of this to the Tribunal in the
document which I have read. I now offer another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1941 the Germans demanded that the circulars, especially the
directive of 29 March 1941 addressed to the prefects regarding the
recruiting of laborers for Germany, should be officially transmitted
to the organizational committees. The occupation authorities
obtained satisfaction through a circular of 25 April, which I submit
to the Tribunal under Exhibit Number RF-41 (Document Number
F-521). But the terms of this circular did not receive the approval
of the German authorities, and on 28 May 1941 Dr. Michel protested
in violent terms to the Delegate General for Franco-German Economic
Relations. This protest constitutes our Document F-522. I
submit it to the Tribunal under Exhibit Number RF-42, and read it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Paris, 28 May 1941.</p>
<hr class='tbk508'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Subject: Recruiting of Workers for Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk509'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Reference: Your letter Number 192 of 29 April 1941.</p>
<hr class='tbk510'/>
<p class='noindent'>“From your explanations I gather that even before my
letter of 23 April was received a circular for the organizational
committees had been drafted and sent on 25 April.</p>
<hr class='tbk511'/>
<p class='noindent'>“This circular, nevertheless, does not seem to me adequate
to support in an efficacious manner the recruiting of workers
carried out by Germany. That is why I consider that it is
necessary that, in a further directive, attention may be
<span class='pageno' title='467' id='Page_467'></span>
drawn to the points which were particularly mentioned by
me on 23 April and I request you to submit to me as soon
as possible the appropriate draft.</p>
<hr class='tbk512'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On the German side an impressive contribution toward the
creating of a favorable atmosphere has been made by means
of the intended release of an additional large number of
prisoners of war, which was considered by you at the time
of our conversation of 24 March as a primary condition for
the success of a reinforced recruiting of workers for Germany.
I am therefore probably not wrong in expecting that you
will send to the economic organizations a communication so
designed that the attitude of expectation, maintained by
French economy up until now, will develop also in the field
of the release of labor into a constructive co-operation. I
therefore expect that you will submit to me your proposals
with all possible speed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And, finally, the German services placed direct pressure upon
the workers themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, moral pressure. The <span class='it'>opération de la relève</span> (prisoner
exchange plan) tried in France in the spring of 1942 is characteristic.
The occupation authorities promised to compensate for
the sending of French workers to Germany by liberating prisoners
of war. The return of a prisoner was to take place upon the
departure of a worker. This promise was fallacious, and reality
was quite different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I quote in this connection the report on compulsory labor and
the deportation of workers, which I submitted this morning to
the Tribunal under Exhibit Number RF-22 (Document Number
F-515).</p>

<p class='pindent'>I quote Page 51, both in the French original and in the German
translation. In the French original it is the third paragraph of
Page 51 and in the German translation the first paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“If the press, inspired by the occupying power, pretends in
its commentaries to applaud the replacement plan of one
prisoner for one worker, it is undoubtedly done to order and
based on calculation; and also it seems because until 20 June
1942, 2 days before the speech cited before”—it was a speech
of the chief of the <span class='it'>de facto</span> government of France—“it was,
indeed, this proportion which the Germans Michel and Ritter
had pretended to accept in their reports to the French
administrative services.</p>
<hr class='tbk513'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The proportion, in fact, of one to five, appears to have been
a last-minute surprise of which the press had never breathed
a word.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='468' id='Page_468'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The pressure of which foreign workers were the victims was
also a material pressure. I said that the fiction of voluntary enrollment
could not be maintained in view of the arrests. I wish to
submit a document to the Tribunal which furnishes a characteristic
example of the German mentality and of the methods utilized by
the National Socialist administrations. This is a document which
in the French archives is Number 527, which I submit to the
Tribunal under Exhibit Number RF-43. This is a letter from the
delegate of the Reich Labor Minister in the French department of
Pas de Calais. This official enjoins a young French workman to
depart for Germany as a free worker under threat of unfavorable
consequences. This is in Exhibit Number RF-43 (Document Number
F-527), third page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Sir:</p>
<hr class='tbk514'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The 26th of March last, in Marquise, I ordered you to go to
work in Germany in your profession. You were to leave with
the convoy of the 1st of April for Germany. You paid no
attention to this summons. I warn you that you must present
yourself, with your baggage, next Monday, 28 April, before
19 hours, at 51 Rue de la Pomme d’Or in Calais. I call your
attention to the fact that you leave for Germany as a free
worker, that you will work there under the same conditions,
and earn the same wages as the German workers.</p>
<hr class='tbk515'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In case you do not present yourself, I must tell you that
unfavorable consequences may very well follow.</p>
<hr class='tbk516'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Delegate for the Labor Ministry of the Reich”—signed—“Hanneran.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The proof of the constraint which the German authorities
exercised on the workers of the occupied territories to bring about
their allegedly voluntary enrollment may be continued. The
National Socialist authorities did not merely impose labor contracts
tainted with violence on foreign workers, they themselves
deliberately failed to honor these contracts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I find proof of this in the fact that they unilaterally prolonged
the duration of the contracts signed by foreign workers. This proof
is based on several documents. Some ordinances were issued by
the Defendant Göring in his capacity as Delegate for the Four Year
Plan; others by the Defendant Sauckel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now call the attention of the Tribunal to an order of Sauckel’s,
dated 29 March 1943, which I submit to the Tribunal under Document
Number RF-44. It is an extract from <span class='it'>Verfügungen, Anordnungen,
Bekanntmachungen</span>, Volume 5, Page 203:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Extension of work contracts, fixed for a period of time, of
foreign workers, who during the time of their contract have,
absented themselves from their work without proper excuse.
<span class='pageno' title='469' id='Page_469'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk517'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Plenipotentiary General for Allocation of Labor decrees:</p>
<hr class='tbk518'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The regular carrying out of the clauses of a contract for a
fixed period of time concluded by a foreign worker necessitates
that the worker should devote all his energy to the
enterprise for the whole duration of the contract. Nevertheless,
it happens that foreign workers as a result of idleness, delays
in their return to work from visits to their homes,”—I draw
the Tribunal’s attention to the following words—“serving
terms of prison, internment in a camp of correction, or for
other reasons, remain absent from their work .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. without
just cause, for a longer or shorter period of time. In such
cases foreign workers cannot be authorized to return to their
country when the period of time has elapsed for which they
agreed to work voluntarily in Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk519'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Such procedure is not in keeping with the spirit of a work
contract for a fixed period of time, whose object is not only
the presence of the foreign worker, but also the work
accomplished by him.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Kept by force in the German factories which they had entered
under compulsion, the foreign workers were neither voluntary
workers nor free workers. The exposé of the methods of German
recruiting will suffice to show the Tribunal the fictitious character
of the voluntary enrollment on which it was supposed to be based.
The foreign workers who agreed to work in the factories of the
National Socialist war industry did not act through free will. Their
number, however, remained limited. The workers of the occupied
territories had the physical and moral courage to resist German
pressure. This is proved in an admission by the Defendant Sauckel,
which I take from the minutes of the meeting of 3 March 1944 of
the Conference of the Four Year Plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is from an extract which has already been read by my
American colleague, Mr. Dodd, so I will not read it again to the
Tribunal. I merely wish to recall that the Defendant Sauckel
admitted that out of 5 million foreign workers who came to Germany,
there were not even 200,000 who came voluntarily. The
resistance of the foreign workers surprised the Defendant Sauckel
as much as it irritated him. One day he expressed his surprise to
a German general who replied, “The difficulty comes from the
fact that you address yourself to patriots who do not share your
ideal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, only force could constrain the patriots of the occupied
territories to work in behalf of the enemy. The National Socialist
authorities resorted to force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans had, from the first, the possibility of imposing their
policy of force on that kind of labor whose particular status
<span class='pageno' title='470' id='Page_470'></span>
guaranteed recruitment and apparent submission—the prisoners of
war. From 1940 on, the German military authorities organized
labor task forces in prison camps. They constantly increased the
importance of these task forces, which were put at the disposal of
agricultural economy and the war industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The importance of the work required from war prisoners is
substantiated by the report on forced labor and the deportation
of workers, which I have submitted to the Tribunal under Exhibit
Number RF-22 (Document Number F-515). We find on Page 68
of the French and German texts the following estimates: There
were, at the end of 1942, 1,036,319 French prisoners of war in
Germany; 987,687 had been assigned to the work groups and only
the surplus, that is 48,632 prisoners, remained unemployed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The utilization of prisoners of war in German factories does not
constitute a distinct phenomenon which can be dissociated from the
general plan for the recruiting of foreign workers; it is, on the
contrary, an integral part of this plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The National Socialists have always considered that the obligation
to work applied just as much to war prisoners as to the
civilian workers of the occupied territories. They have on many
occasions expressed this conviction. I refer especially to three
documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first is the decree of the appointment of the Defendant
Sauckel, which I submitted to the Tribunal at the beginning of my
explanatory remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second document to which I wish to draw the attention of
the Tribunal is the 10th decree of Sauckel, which I submitted some
time ago under Document Number RF-17. This decree formulates
the principle of the obligation to work and applies to war prisoners,
according to the terms of its Article 8.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, Sauckel had, in another document, affirmed that the
prisoners of war were to be subject to work in the same manner
as civilian workers. This is found in the letter which he wrote to
the Defendant Rosenberg on 20 April 1942, some days after his
appointment, to explain his project to the latter. This is Document
016-PS, which my American colleague, Mr. Dodd, has already
submitted to the Tribunal. I present it as Exhibit Number RF-45.
I shall not read from it, but I point out that on Page 20 of the
German text the problem of compulsory labor is treated in the
general heading entitled, “Prisoners of war and foreign workers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These documents bring a double proof to the Tribunal. First
of all, they reveal the willingness of the National Socialists to
force prisoners to work in behalf of the German war economy
within the general frame of their recruiting policy. In the second
place, these documents establish that the utilization of prisoners
<span class='pageno' title='471' id='Page_471'></span>
of war was not undertaken only by military authorities; this
utilization was ordered and systematized by a civilian organization—that
of the Arbeitseinsatz. As well as the responsibility of the
Defendant Keitel, it entails also that of the German leaders who
conducted the labor policy: the Defendant Sauckel, the Defendant
Speer, and the Defendant Göring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal knows that international law regulates the conditions
under which prisoners of war may be forced to work. The
Hague Convention formulated rules which were closely defined
by the Geneva Convention in Articles 27, 31, and 32:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 27: Belligerents may use as workers healthy war
prisoners, according to their rank and their capabilities, with
the exception of officers and corresponding ranks. Nevertheless,
if officers, or those of similar rank, ask for suitable
work, it will be supplied for them as far as possible. Noncommissioned
officers, who are war prisoners, can be required
to work only as supervisors, if they do not expressly request
remunerative occupation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk520'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Article 31: The work furnished by the prisoners of war.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We consider these documents as official and
sufficiently authentic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. HERZOG: These rules of international law determine
positively the legal powers of the nation having prisoners of war in
its custody. It is legitimate to force prisoners of war to work
during their captivity, but this includes three legal limitations:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. It is forbidden to compel noncommissioned officers who are
prisoners to work, unless they have expressly requested to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. War prisoners must not be used for dangerous work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. Prisoners must not be associated with the enemy war effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The National Socialist authorities systematically neglected these
imperative provisions. They exercised violent constraint on noncommissioned
officers held in captivity, to force them to join labor
crews. They included war prisoners as workers in their factories
and in the workyards, without considering the nature of the work
imposed upon them. The utilization of war prisoners by National
Socialist Germany took place under illegal and criminal conditions.
This I affirm and I will prove it to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will take a recess for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>M. HERZOG: Mr. President, Your Honors. From 1941, the Germans
exercised direct pressure on noncommissioned officers to force
<span class='pageno' title='472' id='Page_472'></span>
them to engage in productive work for the Reich war economy.
This pressure, after the failure of propaganda methods, took the
form of reprisals. Insubordinate noncommissioned officers were
subjected to ill-treatment; they were sent to special camps, such as
Coberczyn, where they were put under a disciplinary regime. Some
incurred penal sentences because of their refusal to work. I submit,
as proof, the report of the Ministry of Prisoners, Deportees, and
Refugees of the French Government, Document UK-78(2), which is,
in my document book, Exhibit Number RF-46. The document is in
a white file. I shall read from the bottom of Page 19 in the French
original, Page 10 of the German translation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Work of noncommissioned officers.</p>
<hr class='tbk521'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On this subject the Geneva Convention was explicit:
Noncommissioned officers who are war prisoners can be
subjected to work only as supervisors, unless they make an
express request for a remunerative occupation.</p>
<hr class='tbk522'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In conformity with this article a certain number of noncommissioned
officers refused to work from the beginning of
their captivity. The number of imprisoned noncommissioned
officers was, at the end of 1940, about 130,000 and represented
later a very important source of labor for the Reich. Therefore,
the German authorities strove by every means to
induce the greatest possible number of objectors to work. To
this effect, during the last months of 1941, the noncommissioned
officers who did not volunteer for the work were, in
most camps, subjected to an alternating regime. For a few days
they had to undergo punishments such as the reduction of
food rations, doing without beds, compulsory physical exercises
for a number of hours, and particularly the <span class='it'>pelote</span> (punishment
drill). During another period they were promised work
according to their liking, and other material advantages, for
example, special regulations for insurance, an extra number
of letters, and higher wages. These methods led a certain
number of noncommissioned officers to accept work. The
noncommissioned officers who persisted in their refusal to
work were subjected to a very severe disciplinary regime
and to arduous physical exercises.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The National Socialist military authorities utilized the prisoners
of war for dangerous work. The French, British, Belgian, and
Dutch prisoners were used to transport munitions, to load bombs
on planes, to repair aviation camps, and to construct fortifications.
The proof of the use of prisoners of war for the transport of munitions
and for the loading of bombs on planes is furnished by the
affidavits of repatriated French prisoners of war. These affidavits
<span class='pageno' title='473' id='Page_473'></span>
have been assembled in the report of the Ministry of Prisoners,
which I have just quoted and which I shall quote again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now quote Page 27 of the French document, Page 14 of the
German translation. It is the same document from which I have
just quoted, Exhibit Number RF-46, Page 27:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“(b) The requisition of prisoners for the construction of
fortifications and for the transport of munitions, very often
in the close vicinity of the firing line.</p>
<hr class='tbk523'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The war prisoners, Kommando 274 of Stalag II B, complain,
December 1944, of being employed on Sundays in the
construction of antitank trenches.</p>
<hr class='tbk524'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On 2 February 1945 the prisoners of Stalag II D, evacuated
on account of the advance of the Russian Army, worked, as
soon as they arrived at Sassnitz, at fortification works and
antitank works, in particular around the city.</p>
<hr class='tbk525'/>
<p class='noindent'>“After falling back from Stalag III B, the war prisoners were
engaged until the end of April in earthworks, digging
trenches, and in transporting aviation bombs.</p>
<hr class='tbk526'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Kommando 553 at Lebus was obliged to carry out work in
the front lines under the fire of Russian artillery. Numerous
comrades, drawn back to Fürstenwalde, were employed in
loading bombs on German bombers. In spite of their protests
to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva
and to the colonel commanding Stalag III B, about billeting
in barns, very bad hygiene, and insufficient food, the latter
answered that he was obeying superior orders of the OKW,
ordering the prisoners to dig trenches.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The National Socialist leaders, for that matter, admitted that
they used French and British prisoners of war for military work
on airdromes exposed to Allied bombardment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I offer in proof two notes, the first addressed by the OKH to the
War Prisoners Section of the Wehrmacht, and the second by
“Wilhelmstrasse” to the German representative of the Reich
Foreign Office at the Wiesbaden Armistice Commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The memorandum of the OKH, dated 7 October 1940, constitutes
Document F-549; I submit it to the Tribunal under Exhibit Number
RF-47, and I read it in full:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The demand of the French Delegation shall be considered
unfounded. The lodging of war prisoners in camps situated
in the vicinity of aviation fields is not in contradiction to the
rules of the rights of nations.</p>
<hr class='tbk527'/>
<p class='noindent'>“According to Article 9, Paragraph 4, of the Convention on
the Treatment of War Prisoners, of 27 July 1929, no prisoners
of war shall be exposed to the fire of the combat zone.
<span class='pageno' title='474' id='Page_474'></span>
Combat zone in this sense is to be understood as the space
in which normally a battle between two armies is carried on,
thus extending to a depth of about 20 kilometers from the
advance line. Places exposed to possible aerial attacks,
however, do not belong to the combat zone. In this age of
air warfare there no longer exists any sure shelter. The fact
of using war prisoners for the construction of a camp and
for the repairing of destroyed runways does not seem to
lend itself to any controversy.</p>
<hr class='tbk528'/>
<p class='noindent'>“According to Article 31 of the Convention quoted above,
war prisoners must not be used in works directly related to
war activity. The construction of shelters, houses, and camps
is not directly a war act. It is recognized that war prisoners
may be employed in the construction of roads. Accordingly
their utilization for the reconstruction of aviation camps
that have been destroyed is permissible. On the roads,
trucks, tanks, ammunition cars, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, are driven, and on
the aviation fields there are planes. It is all the same.</p>
<hr class='tbk529'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On the other hand, it would be illegal to use war prisoners
for loading bombs, munitions, <span class='it'>et cetera</span> on bombers. This
would be work directly related to war activity.</p>
<hr class='tbk530'/>
<p class='noindent'>“By reason of the legal position explained above, the OKH
has rejected the idea of withdrawing French prisoners of war
employed on work in the aviation camps.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I draw the attention of the Tribunal to this document. It
emphasized the bad faith of the leaders of National Socialist Germany,
which was two-fold: In the first place, the note of 7 October
1940, which I have read, acknowledges that it is forbidden by
international law to use prisoners of war for the loading of bombs
and ammunitions on bombers. But I have just brought proof to the
Tribunal that the French prisoners of war were used for this
purpose. In the second place, the note of the OKH disputes the
dangerous character of the work carried out on the aviation fields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the note of “Wilhelmstrasse,” to which I shall now refer, and
which I submit to the Tribunal under Exhibit Number RF-48 (Document
Number F-550), recognizes, on the contrary, that prisoners
forced to work on an aviation field incur grave danger because of
the military purpose of this work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will read to the Tribunal a note of the German Foreign
Office dated 14 February 1941, Exhibit Number RF-48 (Document
Number F-550):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 87 of the Agreement of 1929 on Prisoners of War
provides that, in case of difference of opinion on the subject
<span class='pageno' title='475' id='Page_475'></span>
of the interpretation of the Agreement, the protecting powers
shall offer their services to settle the dispute. To accomplish
this, any protecting power may propose a meeting of representatives
of the belligerent powers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. France herself assumes
the responsibilities of a protecting power in questions on
prisoners of war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall pass on from this quotation to Paragraph 2 of the same
document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As to the point in dispute, it is well to call attention to
the following:</p>
<hr class='tbk531'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The French conception, according to which prisoners of
war may not be quartered near airfields and may not be
employed in repairing runways, cannot be based on the exact
content of Articles 9 and 31; but, on the other hand, it is
certain that French prisoners of war quartered and employed
under these conditions are in a particularly dangerous
situation, because the airfields in occupied territories are used
exclusively for German military purposes and thus constitute
a special objective for enemy air attacks.</p>
<hr class='tbk532'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The American Embassy in Berlin has likewise made a
protest against a similar use of British prisoners of war in
Germany. So far no answer has been made, because a rejection
of this protest might result in German prisoners being
employed in similar work in England.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The utilization of war prisoners for the construction of fortifications
is substantiated by Document 828-PS, which I file with the
Tribunal under Exhibit Number RF-49. It is a letter of 29 September
1944, addressed by the Chief of the German 1st Army Corps to the
OKW, to give an account of work on fortifications accomplished by
80 Belgian prisoners of war. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“According to the teletype referred to, it is reported that
in the territory of Stalag I A, Stablack Einsatzbereich 2-213,
Tilsit-Loten near Ragnit, there are 40 Belgian prisoners of
war and in Lindbach, near Neusiedel, 40 Belgian prisoners of
war, who are employed on fortification work.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There remains the task of proving that Allied prisoners, forced
to work in Reich armament factories, were associated with the
enemy war effort. To this end I first offer Document 1206-PS. This
document is a memorandum, dated 11 November 1941, concerning a
report made 7 November 1941 by the Reich Marshal. The document,
consequently, establishes the direct responsibility of the Defendant
Göring. The use of Russian war prisoners is treated in a general
way in this document, but it deals also with the use of war prisoners
<span class='pageno' title='476' id='Page_476'></span>
of Western European countries. I submit this document to the
Tribunal as Exhibit Number RF-50, and I read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Berlin, 11 November 1941.</p>
<hr class='tbk533'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Notes on report made by the Reich Marshal at a meeting
of 7 November 1941 in the Reich Ministry for Air.</p>
<hr class='tbk534'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Subject: Employment of Russian labor in the war economy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Has that already been put in by the United
States?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. HERZOG: I think, Mr. President, that it was presented by
the United States Prosecution. I shall, therefore, simply quote an
extract, the fifth and sixth paragraphs of the first page, concerning
the employment of French and Belgian war prisoners on individual
employment in the economy of armament. This use of war prisoners
in the Reich munitions factories corresponded to a common plan.
It is the result of a systematic policy. The administrative offices
for labor deliberately assigned to armament factories all war
prisoners who seemed capable of carrying out skilled work. I quote,
in this connection, Document 3005-PS, Exhibit RF-51. It is a circular
addressed, in 1941, by the Ministry of Labor to the heads of employment
offices concerning the use of French and Russian prisoners of
war. This document has been submitted and commented upon by
my American colleague, Mr. Dodd. I shall, therefore, not read it.
I simply point out that this circular deals with the employment of
all French war prisoners in the armament factories of the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the capitulation of Italy, Italian soldiers who had fallen
into the hands of the Germans—they were not called prisoners of
war, but rather “military internees”—were forced to work. I offer
in this connection, a directive of the Defendant Bormann, of
28 September 1943, Document 657-PS, which I submit to the
Tribunal under Exhibit Number RF-52.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Italian military internees were in three categories; some
asked to continue the struggle on the side of the German army;
others desired to keep a neutral attitude; others turned their arms
against their former allies. The military internees of the second
and third categories were, in the terms of the circular, to be forced
to work. I read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Circular Number 55/43 G.R.S., top secret. Concerning the
treatment and employment of Italian military internees.</p>
<hr class='tbk535'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The OKW, in connection with the Plenipotentiary General
for Allocation of Labor, has regulated the treatment and the
employment of Italian military internees. The most important
directions of the ordinances of the OKW are the following.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='477' id='Page_477'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall skip the rest of the first page and proceed to Page 2 of
the French translation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Italian internees who, when investigated, do not
declare themselves ready to continue the struggle under
German command, are put at the disposal of the Plenipotentiary
General for Allocation of Labor, who has already
given the necessary instructions for their employment to the
heads of the regional labor offices.</p>
<hr class='tbk536'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It is to be noted that Italian military internees must not
be employed together with the British and American prisoners
of war.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The prisoners of war offered passive resistance to German force.
The National Socialist authorities intervened again and again to
attempt to increase their output. I refer to Document 233-PS, which
I submit to the Tribunal under Exhibit Number RF-53. It is a
directive of the OKW of 17 August 1944. The purpose is to indicate
to the war prisoner bureaus measures capable of increasing the
production of the prisoners. I read from the document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Subject: Treatment of War Prisoners—Increase in Production.</p>
<hr class='tbk537'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The measures taken until now with regard to the treatment
of war prisoners and the increasing of their production
have not given the hoped-for results. The offices of the Party
and those of economy continually complain of the poor labor
output of all the war prisoners. The object of this circular
is to make known the directives for prisoners of war made in
agreement with all interested offices of the Party and State.
Accordingly all guard companies and their auxiliaries are to
be given detailed instructions.</p>
<hr class='tbk538'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. Collaboration with the Hoheitsträger of the NSDAP.</p>
<hr class='tbk539'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The co-operation of all officers in charge of war prisoners
with the Hoheitsträger of the Party must be intensified to an
even greater extent. To this end the commanders of the
prisoners-of-war camps shall immediately detail, for all the
Kreise in their command, an energetic officer acquainted with
all questions concerning prisoners of war, to act as liaison
officer to the Kreisleiter. This officer shall have the duty of
settling in closest collaboration with the Kreisleiter, according
to the instructions of the camp commander, all questions concerning
prisoners of war which might be of public interest.</p>
<hr class='tbk540'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The aim of this collaboration must be: (a) To increase
the labor output of war prisoners; (b) to solve all arising
difficulties quickly and on the spot; (c) to organize the
employment of war prisoners in the Kreise in such a way that
it meets with the political, military, and economic requirements.
<span class='pageno' title='478' id='Page_478'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk541'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Chancellery of the Party will give the necessary orders
to the Gauleiter and the Kreisleiter.</p>
<hr class='tbk542'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. Treatment of prisoners of war. The treatment of
prisoners of war shall be dictated, within limits compatible
with security, by the sole purpose of increasing the labor output
to the utmost extent. In addition to just treatment,
providing the prisoners with the food due them according to
stipulations, and with proper billets, supervision of the labor
output is necessary to achieve this highest possible production.</p>
<hr class='tbk543'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Available means must be employed with extreme rigor as
regards lazy and rebellious prisoners.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The resistance of war prisoners caused the German labor bureaus
to use a subterfuge to force them to work. I refer to the operation
called the transformation of war prisoners into free workers.
It consisted in transforming prisoners of war into so-called free
workers, to whom a labor contract was offered. The operation was
perfected by the Defendant Sauckel in the course of one of his trips
to Paris on 9 April 1943. To Germany it offered the advantage of
permitting the use of transformed prisoners in armament factories
without directly violating the Geneva Convention. For the prisoners
it presented only an illusory advantage, the decrease of the
surveillance to which they were subjected. In reality the length and
the nature of the work imposed upon them was in no way changed;
their housing conditions and the quality of their rations remained
unchanged. Moreover, this operation, presented by German propaganda
as a special measure to war prisoners, brought about a
deterioration of their legal status.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prisoners of war were not fooled; in most cases they refused
to co-operate with this German maneuver. Some agreed to do it, but
a number of these took advantage of the first leave granted them
because of their change in status, and fled. The report of the
Statistical Institute on Forced Labor, which I submitted to the
Tribunal this morning under Exhibit Number RF-22, (Document
Number F-515) gives in this connection the following information.
I quote it, Page 70 of the French text, Page 70 of the German translation.
I shall read the second paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The transformation of prisoners into ‘free’ workers, which
was realized or carried out as the second Sauckel act and
which because of this fact must be counted in the present list
as dating from 25 April 1943, was decided by him, Sauckel, in
the course of a trip to Paris on 9 April 1943. It was to afford,
after the prisoner had signed his contract, leave to go to
France which was dependent on the return of the men who
had gone on leave before. Two attempts were made to carry
<span class='pageno' title='479' id='Page_479'></span>
out this plan. As of 24 April 1943, out of 1,000 on leave, 43 did
not return. In the month of August following, out of 8,000 on
leave, 2,000 did not return. A last appeal directed to them
was published in the press of 17 August without result. There
is no third experiment, and the transformation in practice
limited itself to the removal of sentinels and of camp guards,
but did not change either the nature or the duration of the
work or the housing conditions or the rations. On the other
hand, it entailed loss of rights to receive packages from the
International Red Cross and loss of the diplomatic protection
of prisoners of war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The forced utilization of war prisoners did not permit the German
authorities to solve the labor problem of the war economy.
That is why they applied their policy of force to the civilian
populations of the occupied territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The National Socialist authorities systemized their policy of
force, from 1942 on, by instituting compulsory labor in the different
occupied territories. From the end of 1941 it has been confirmed
that neither the recruiting of voluntary workers nor the utilization
of prisoners led to a solution of the problem of the labor required
for the war economy. The Germans then decided to proceed to the
forced enrollment of civilian workers. They decreed a veritable
civilian mobilization, the execution of which characterizes their
criminal activity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I refer to a circular of 29 January 1942, issued by Dr. Mansfeld
on the responsibility of the Defendant Göring. I remind the Tribunal
that I have submitted this Document Number 1183-PS already
under Exhibit Number RF-26. I read the passage from the document
where I stopped this morning, Page 2, last paragraph of the French
translation, Page 2; last paragraph also of the German original:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In order to avoid effects detrimental to the armament industry,
all considerations must yield to the necessity of filling
in every case the gaps in the labor supply caused by extensive
drafting into the Wehrmacht. To this end the forced mobilization
of workers from the occupied territories must not be
overlooked if voluntary recruitment should not succeed. The
mere possibility of compulsory mobilization will, in many
cases, facilitate recruiting.</p>
<hr class='tbk544'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Therefore I ask you to take immediate steps in your district
to promote the employment of workers in the German Reich
on a voluntary basis. I herewith request you to prepare for
publication, regulations to render possible forced mobilization
of labor in your territory for Germany, so that they may be
decreed at once in case recruiting on a voluntary basis remains
without the success necessary to relieve labor in the Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='480' id='Page_480'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The appointment of the Defendant Sauckel may be considered
as preparatory measure for the establishment of compulsory labor.
It was necessary that a central authority be set up in order to co-ordinate
the activity of the different labor departments to proceed
to the mobilization of civilian workers. The terms explaining the
motives of the decree of appointment are explicit: The mission of
the Plenipotentiary for Allocation of Labor consists in satisfying the
labor needs of the German economy through the recruiting of
foreign workers and the utilization of war prisoners. The decree of
Sauckel dated 22 August 1942, which I have submitted to the Tribunal
under Document Number RF-17, expresses, moreover, the
will of the defendant to set about recruiting by means of coercion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The institution of compulsory labor represents deliberate violation
of international conventions. The deportation of workers is forbidden
by several stipulated regulations which have the value of actual
law. I shall quote, first of all, Article 52 of the Annex to the Fourth
Convention of the Hague. I have already given a commentary on
it to the Tribunal to demonstrate that the requisitioning of labor
effected by the occupation authorities was illegal. Much more, the
institution of compulsory labor was prohibited by Article 52. Compulsory
labor was imposed upon foreign workers in the interest
of the German war economy. It was carried out in armament factories
of National Socialist Germany. It deprived the occupied territories
of labor necessary for the rational exploitation of their wealth.
It therefore is not within the framework of that labor requisition
which Article 52 of the Hague Convention authorizes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prohibition of forced labor is, moreover, affirmed by
another international convention. It is a question of the Convention
of 25 September 1926 on slavery, of which Germany is a
signatory. This treaty makes forced labor equivalent to slavery
in its Article 5. I ask the Tribunal to refer to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deportation of workers is the subject of a formal prohibition.
Forced labor in German war factories was, therefore, instituted in
flagrant violation of international law and of all pledges subscribed
to by Germany. The National Socialist authorities transgressed
positive international law; they likewise violated the law of nations.
The latter guarantees individual liberty, on which the principle of
forced recruitment is a characteristic attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The violation of treaties and the contempt of the rights of individuals
are the tenets of National Socialist doctrine. Therefore,
the defendants proceeded not merely to the mobilization of foreign
workers; they proclaimed the necessity and the legitimacy of forced
labor. I shall, first of all, indicate to the Tribunal certain declarations
made by the defendants which amount to admissions. I shall
thereupon indicate how the occupation authorities introduced the
<span class='pageno' title='481' id='Page_481'></span>
service of compulsory work in the different occupied territories.
I shall demonstrate, finally, that the Germans took measures of
violent coercion in an attempt to assure the execution of the
civilian mobilization which had been decreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The legitimacy of forced enrollment has been upheld by Hitler.
The proof of this can be found in the report of the Führer conferences
held on 10, 11, and 12 August 1942. It is contained in
Document R-124 which I presented this morning under Exhibit
Number RF-30. I shall not read it to the Tribunal, because my
American colleague, Mr. Dodd, has done so during his presentation
on forced labor. I point out that the document to which I refer
indicates that the Führer was in agreement with the exercise of all
the necessary compulsion in the East as well as in the West, if the
question of recruiting foreign workers could not be regulated on a
voluntary basis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The necessity of making use of compulsory labor was expressed
in identical terms by certain defendants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not stress the numerous statements of the Defendant
Sauckel to which I have already drawn the attention of the Tribunal.
The explanatory statement of his decree of 22 August 1942,
the program included in his letter of 24 April 1942, and the policy
advocated in his speech at Posen in February 1943, reproduce faithfully
the determination of the defendant to justify the principle
of forced recruiting. I shall not revert to this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I present to the Tribunal the declaration of the Defendant Jodl.
This declaration is an extract from a long speech made by General
Jodl, 7 November 1943 at Munich before an audience of Gauleiter.
This speech is Document L-172. I offer it in evidence to the Tribunal
under Exhibit Number RF-54. I shall read Page 2 of the
French translation, Pages 38 and 39 of the German original:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The dilemma of manpower shortage has led to the idea of
making more thorough use of the manpower reserves in the
territories occupied by us. Here right and wrong conceptions
are mixed together. I believe that as far as labor is concerned,
the utmost has been done, but where this is not yet
the case, it would appear preferable from the political point
of view to abstain from compulsory measures and instead to
aim at order and economic effort. In my opinion, however,
the time has now come to take steps with remorseless vigor
and resolution in Denmark, Holland, France, and Belgium
to compel thousands of idle persons to carry out fortification
work, which takes precedence over all other tasks. The
necessary orders for this have already been given.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The German Labor Service had not waited for the appeal of
General Jodl to decree the mobilization of civilian foreign workers.
<span class='pageno' title='482' id='Page_482'></span>
I am going to show the Tribunal how compulsory labor was instituted
and organized in France, Norway, Belgium, and Holland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to remind the Tribunal that in Denmark there was
never any legal regulation for forced labor and that forced labor
was carried out as a simple <span class='it'>de facto</span> measure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I also wish to remind the Tribunal that compulsory labor was
introduced in a special form in Luxembourg and in the French
departments of Alsace and Lorraine. The occupation authorities
incorporated the citizens of Luxembourg and the French citizens
residing in the departments of Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin, and Moselle,
in the labor service of the Reich. This incorporation was carried
out by ordinances of Gauleiter Simon and Gauleiter Wagner. The
ordinances constitute an integral part of the Germanization plan
for territories of Luxembourg, Alsace, and Lorraine. Their scope
exceeds that of the measures of forced enrollment which were
taken in other occupied territories. That is why I refer the Tribunal,
on this point, to the explanation which will be given in the
trial brief of M. Edgar Faure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two German texts of a general nature serve as a foundation
for the legislation on forced labor in the occupied territories of
Western Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first is the decree of Sauckel of 22 August 1942, to which
I have drawn the attention of the Tribunal on several occasions.
This decree prescribes the mobilization of all civilian workers in
the service of the war economy. Article 2 prescribes that this
decree is applicable to occupied territories. This decree of
22 August 1942 thus constitutes the legal charter of the civilian
mobilization of foreign workers. This mobilization was confirmed
by an order of the Führer of 8 September 1942. It is Document
556(2)-PS, Exhibit Number RF-55, which I submit to the Tribunal
and from which I shall read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Führer and Supreme Commander of the Wehrmacht;
General Headquarters of the Führer: 8 September 1942.</p>
<hr class='tbk545'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The extensive coastal fortifications which I have ordered
to be erected in the area of Army Group West necessitate
in the occupied territory the utilization of all available
workers to the fullest extent and to their utmost capacity.
The assignment of indigenous workers, made up to now, is
insufficient. In order to increase it, I order the introduction
of compulsory labor and the prohibition of changing the
place of employment without permission of the authorities
in the occupied territories.</p>
<hr class='tbk546'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Furthermore, in future, the distribution of food and clothing
ration cards to those subject to compulsory labor shall
depend on the possession of a certificate of employment.
<span class='pageno' title='483' id='Page_483'></span>
Refusal to accept an assigned job, as well as leaving the
place of work without the consent of the authorities in
charge, will result in the withdrawal of the food and clothing
ration cards.</p>
<hr class='tbk547'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The GBA”—that is, the office of the Defendant Sauckel—“in
agreement with the military commanders or the Reich Commissioners,
will issue the appropriate directives.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The forced enrollment of foreign workers was preceded by
preliminary measures to which the order of 8 September 1942
refers—which I have just read. I am speaking of the freezing of
labor. To carry out the mobilization of workers it was necessary
for the public services to exercise strict control over their use in
the industrial enterprises of occupied territories. This control had
a double purpose: It was to facilitate the census of workers suitable
for work in Germany and to prevent workers from avoiding the
German requisition by alleging a real or fictitious employment. The
National Socialist authorities exercised this control by restricting
the liberty of hiring and discharging, which they had given to the
authorities of the labor bureaus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In France, the freezing of labor was brought about by the law
of 4 September 1942. I shall shortly explain to the Tribunal the
conditions under which this law was formulated. I shall, for the
moment, simply submit it to the Tribunal under Document Number
RF-56 and ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Belgium, the freezing of labor was carried out by the
ordinance of the military commanding officer of 6 October 1942.
I submit Document Number RF-57, of which I ask the Tribunal
to take judicial notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, in Holland, where compulsory labor was instituted as
early as 1941, an ordinance of the Reich Commissioner, dated
28 February 1941, which I offer to the Tribunal under Document
Number RF-58, organized the freezing of labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The immobilization of labor was brought about under an economic
pretext in all countries. In reality it constituted a preliminary
measure for the mobilization of workers, which the National
Socialists immediately proceeded to carry out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In France compulsory labor was established by the legislation
of the pseudo-government of Vichy, but this legislation was
imposed upon the <span class='it'>de facto</span> French authorities by the defendants,
and especially by Sauckel. The action which Sauckel brought
against the Government of Vichy, to force it to favor the deportation
of workers into Germany, was exercised in four phases:
I shall briefly review for the Tribunal the history of these four
Sauckel actions.
<span class='pageno' title='484' id='Page_484'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The first Sauckel action was initiated in the spring of 1942, soon
after the appointment of the defendant as Plenipotentiary for Allocation
of Labor. The German armament industry had an urgent
need of workers. The service of the Arbeitseinsatz had decided to
recruit 150,000 skilled workers in France. Sauckel came to Paris
in the month of June 1942. He had several conversations with
French ministers. Otto Abetz, German ambassador in Paris,
presided over these meetings. They brought about, the following
results:</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of the reluctance of French authorities to establish compulsory
labor, it was decided that the recruiting of 150,000 skilled
workers should be carried out by a pseudo-voluntary enrollment.
This was the beginning of the so-called exchange operation, to which
I have already drawn the attention of the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Tribunal knows that the exchange operation was a
failure and that, despite an intensification of German propaganda,
the number of voluntary enrollments remained at a minimum. The
German authorities then put the Vichy Government under the
necessity of proceeding to forced enrollment. I offer in evidence
the denunciatory letter of 26 August 1942, addressed by the German,
Dr. Michel, Chief of the Administrative Staff, to the Delegate
General for Franco-German economic relations. This is French
Document F-530, which I shall submit to the Tribunal as Exhibit
Number RF-59:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Paris, 26 August 1942.</p>
<hr class='tbk548'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Military Commander in France, economic section; to M.
Barnaud, Delegate General for Franco-German Economic
Relations; Paris.</p>
<hr class='tbk549'/>
<p class='noindent'>“President Laval promised Gauleiter Sauckel, Plenipotentiary
General for Allocation of Labor, to make every effort to send
to Germany, to help German armament economy, 350,000
workers, of which 150,000 should be metal workers.</p>
<hr class='tbk550'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The French Government intended at first to solve this
problem by recruitment, especially of the <span class='it'>affectés spéciaux</span>.
This method has been abandoned and that of voluntary
enrollment has been attempted with a view to the liberation
of prisoners. The past months have shown that the end in
view cannot be achieved by means of voluntary recruitment.</p>
<hr class='tbk551'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In France, German armament orders have increased in
volume and urgency. Moreover, special tasks have been set,
the accomplishment of which depends upon the supply of a
very considerable number of workers.</p>
<hr class='tbk552'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In order to assure the realization of the tasks for which
France is responsible in the sphere of the Arbeitseinsatz,
<span class='pageno' title='485' id='Page_485'></span>
the French Government must now be asked to put into execution
the following measures:</p>
<hr class='tbk553'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1) The publication of a decree, concerning change of place
of work. By virtue of this decree, leaving the place of
employment and engaging labor depends on the approval of
certain specified authorities.</p>
<hr class='tbk554'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2) The institution of compulsory registration of all persons
out of work, as well as of those who do not work full-time
or are not permanently employed. This compulsory registration
is to ensure the fullest recruitment possible of all the
reserves still available.</p>
<hr class='tbk555'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3) The publication of a decree for the mobilization of workers
for tasks important to the policy of state. This decree
is to ensure: (a) The necessary labor for Germany; (b) the
workers necessary in France for the carrying out of orders
which have been transferred there and the workers needed
for special tasks.</p>
<hr class='tbk556'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4) Publication of a decree ensuring an adequate supply of
apprentices. This decree is to impose upon French enterprise
the duty of turning out, by means of apprenticeship and
systematic training, young workers possessing adequate
qualifications.</p>
<hr class='tbk557'/>
<p class='noindent'>“For the Military Commander, the Chief of the Administrative
Staff.”—signed—“Dr. Michel.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Michel’s letter forms the basis for the law relative to the
utilization and the allocation of labor. It is the law of 4 September
1942, which I have submitted to the Tribunal under Document
Number RF-56.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In application of the law, all Frenchmen between 18 and 50
who did not have employment for more than 30 hours a week, were
forced to state this at their local town hall. A decree of 19 September
1942 and a directive of 22 September provided regulations as
to how this declaration had to be made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel’s first action was achieved through a legislative plan;
the defendant had merely to dip into the labor resources which
were established by it. But the resistance of the French workers
caused his recruiting plan to fail. This is why Sauckel undertook
his second action, beginning in January 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second Sauckel action is marked by the introduction of
compulsory labor, properly speaking. Until then workers had been
the only victims of the policy of force of the defendants. The latter
understood the demagogic argument which they could derive from
this <span class='it'>de facto</span> situation. They explained that it was inadmissible
that the working classes of the occupied territory should be the only
<span class='pageno' title='486' id='Page_486'></span>
ones to participate in the German war effort. They demanded that
the basis of forced labor be enlarged by the introduction of compulsory
labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was established by two measures. A directive of
2 February 1943 prescribed a general census of all French males
born between 1 January 1912 and 1 January 1921. The census took
place between 15 and 23 February. It had just been put in force
when the law and decree of 16 February 1943 appeared. These
regulations introduced compulsory labor for all young men born
between 1 January 1920 and 31 December 1922. I submit them
to the Tribunal under Documents Numbers RF-60 and 61, of which
I ask the Court to take judicial notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The action carried out by the defendants to impose this exceptional
legislation is substantiated by numerous documents.
I particularly draw the attention of the Tribunal to four of these,
which permit us to retrace the activities of the Defendant Sauckel
during the months of January and February 1943. On 5 January
1943 Sauckel transmitted to the different departments of his
administration an order of the Führer, which the Defendant Speer
had communicated to him. This is Document 556(13)-PS, which
I submit to the Tribunal under Exhibit Number RF-62. I shall read
its first paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On 4 January 1943, at 8 o’clock in the evening, Minister
Speer telephoned from the general headquarters of the
Führer giving the information that, by virtue of a decision
of the Führer, it was no longer necessary, when recruiting
skilled and unskilled labor in France, to have any particular
regard for the French. Recruitment could be carried on there
with pressure and more severe measures.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 11 January 1943 the Defendant Sauckel was in Paris. He
attended a meeting which brought together at the Military Commander’s
all responsible officials of the labor service. He announced
to them that new measures of compulsion were to be taken in
France. I refer you to the minutes of the meeting which constitute
Document 1342-PS, which I submit to the Tribunal under Exhibit
Number RF-63. I shall read from Page 2 of the French translation;
Page 1, fourth line, of the second paragraph of the German original:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Gauleiter Sauckel likewise thanks the various services for
the successful carrying out of the first action. Immediately
after the beginning of the new year, he is obliged to announce
further severe measures. There is a great new need of labor
for the front as well as for the Reich armament industry.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I skip to the end of the paragraph. I shall read from the next
paragraph:

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The situation at the front calls for 700,000 soldiers fit for
front-line service. The armament industry would have to
lose 200,000 key workers by the middle of March. I have
received an order from the Führer to find 200,000 foreign
skilled workers as replacements and I shall need for this
purpose 150,000 French skilled workmen, while the other
50,000 can be drawn from Holland, Belgium, and other
occupied countries. In addition, 100,000 unskilled French
workers are necessary for the Reich. The second action of
recruitment in France makes it necessary that by the middle
of March 150,000 skilled workers and 100,000 unskilled
workmen and women be transferred to Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Sauckel went back to Germany a few days
later. On 16 February he was in Berlin at the meeting of the
Central Planning Board. He gave a commentary on the law which
was to appear that very day and revealed that he was the instigator
of it. I refer once more to the minutes of the conferences of the
Four Year Plan, included under Document Number R-124, which I
submitted this morning to the Tribunal under Exhibit Number
RF-30. I shall read an extract from this document, which my
American colleagues have not mentioned. It is Page 7 of the French
translation of the document, Page 2284 of the German original;
this is the situation in France:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“My collaborators and I having succeeded, after difficult
discussions, in persuading Laval to introduce the law of
compulsory labor in France, this law has now been so
successfully extended, thanks to our pressure, that by yesterday
three French age-groups had already been called up. So
we are now legally qualified to recruit in France, with the
assistance of the French Government, workers of three age-groups
whom we shall be able to employ henceforth in
French factories, but among whom we shall also be able to
choose some for our own needs in the Reich and send them
to Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Sauckel returned to France on 24 February.
I offer in evidence to the Tribunal the letter which he addressed
to Hitler before his departure, to inform him of his journey. It
proves the continuity of the action of Sauckel. The letter constitutes
Document 556(25)-PS, which I submit to the Tribunal under Exhibit
Number RF-64, and I shall read it:</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='489' id='Page_489'></span><h1>THIRTY-EIGHTH DAY<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>Saturday, 19 January 1946</span></h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>M. HERZOG: Mr. President, Your Honors, at the end of yesterday’s
session I was expounding to the Tribunal the conditions under
which the compulsory labor service was progressively imposed in
France. I reached the second action of the Defendant Sauckel as
set out in the laws and decrees of 16 February 1943. Sauckel’s
second action accelerated the enforced enrollment of Frenchmen
during the months of February and March 1943. Several tens of
thousands of young men of the 1940 and 1942 classes were deported
to Germany by the application of the law of 16 February. The
tempo of these deportations slowed down in the month of April,
but the Arbeitseinsatz immediately formulated new requirements.
On 9 April 1943 the Defendant Sauckel asked the French authorities
to furnish him with 120,000 workers during the month of May and
100,000 during the month of June. In June he made it known that
he wished to effect the transfer of 500,000 workers up to 31 December.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel’s third action was about to begin. It was to be marked,
on 3 June 1943, by the total mobilization of the 1942 class. All
exemptions provided by the law of 16 February and subsequent
texts were withdrawn, and the young men of the 1942 class were
tracked down throughout France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In reality, Sauckel’s third action was especially manifested by
a violent pressure on the part of the defendant, tending towards
a mass deportation by forced recruiting. I offer in evidence three
documents which testify to the action taken by Sauckel in the
summer of 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first document is a letter from Sauckel to Hitler, dated
27 June 1943. Drafted by the defendant upon his return from a trip
to France, it contains an outlined plan for the recruiting of French
workers for the second half of 1943. Its object was, on the one hand,
to secure 1 million workers to be assigned in France to French
armament factories and, on the other hand, 500,000 French workers
to be deported to Germany. This letter constitutes Document
556(39)-PS, which I submit to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number
RF-65. I quote:
<span class='pageno' title='490' id='Page_490'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Weimar, 27 June 1943.</p>
<hr class='tbk566'/>
<p class='noindent'>“My Führer:</p>
<hr class='tbk567'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Herewith I beg to report my return from my official trip
to France.</p>
<hr class='tbk568'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Inasmuch as the free labor reserves in the territories occupied
by the German Armed Forces have been, numerically,
absorbed to saturation point, I am now carefully examining
the possibilities of mobilizing additional labor reserves in
the Reich and the occupied territories to work on German
war production.</p>
<hr class='tbk569'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In my reports of 20 April I was allowed to point out that
intensive and careful utilization must be made of European
labor forces in territories submitted to direct German influence.</p>
<hr class='tbk570'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It was the purpose of my recent stay in Paris to investigate
the possibilities still existing in France for the recruitment
of labor by extensive conferences and my own personal inspection.
On the basis of a carefully established balance sheet
I have come to the following decision:</p>
<hr class='tbk571'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. Assuming that war economy measures are carried out in
France which would at least prove partially effective or
approximately approach, in efficacy, the measures carried out
in Germany, a further million workers, both men and women,
could be assigned to the French war and armament industries
up to December 1943 for work on German orders and
assignments. In this case additional German orders might be
placed in France.</p>
<hr class='tbk572'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. In consideration of these measures and given a careful
study of the subject together with the co-operation of our
German armament services and the German labor recruiting
offices, it should be possible to transfer a further 500,000
workers, both men and women, from France to the Reich
between now and the end of the year.</p>
<hr class='tbk573'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The prerequisites for the realization of this program, drafted
by me are as follows:</p>
<hr class='tbk574'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. Closest collaboration between all German offices especially
in dealing with the French services.</p>
<hr class='tbk575'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. A constant check on French economy by joint commissions,
as already agreed upon by the Reich Minister of Armaments
and War Production Party Member Speer, and myself.</p>
<hr class='tbk576'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. Constant, skillful, and successful propaganda against the
cliques of De Gaulle and Giraud.</p>
<hr class='tbk577'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4. The guarantee of adequate food supplies to the French
population working for Germany.
<span class='pageno' title='491' id='Page_491'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk578'/>
<p class='noindent'>“5. An emphatic insistence on this urgency before the French
Government, in particular before Marshal Pétain, who still
represents the main obstacle to the further recruiting of
French women for compulsory labor.</p>
<hr class='tbk579'/>
<p class='noindent'>“6. A pronounced increase in the program which I have
already introduced in France, for retraining workers to trades
essential to war production.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I skip the next and read the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I therefore beg you, my Führer, to approve my suggestion
of making available 1 million French men and women for
German war production in France proper in the second half
of 1943 and, in addition, of transferring 500,000 French men
and women to the Reich before the end of the current year.</p>
<hr class='tbk580'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Yours faithfully and obediently,”—Signed—“Fritz Sauckel.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The document to which I would now like to call the Tribunal’s
attention proves that the Führer gave his approval to Sauckel’s
program. A note drawn up on 28 July 1943 by Dr. Stothfang, under
the letterhead of the Plenipotentiary General for Allocation of
Labor (Arbeitseinsatz), gives a report on a discussion between
Sauckel and the Führer. It is Document 556(41)-PS, which I submit
to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number RF-66. I shall limit myself to
reading the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“d) The transfer envisaged for the end of the year of 1 million
French workers to the war industries in France, and the
intended transportation of 500,000 other French workers to
the interior of the Reich has been approved by the Führer.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Finally a document establishes that the Defendant Sauckel, on
the strength of Hitler’s approval, attempted to realize his program
by working on the French authorities. This document is a letter
from Sauckel to Hitler. It is dated 13 August 1943, upon the defendant’s
return from a trip to France, Belgium, and Holland. It is
Document 556(43)-PS. I shall read it to the Tribunal. It is Exhibit
Number RF-67:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Weimar, 13 August 1943.</p>
<hr class='tbk581'/>
<p class='noindent'>“My Führer:</p>
<hr class='tbk582'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I beg to report my return from my official trip to France,
Belgium and Holland. In tough, difficult, and tedious negotiations
I have imposed upon the occupied Western territories,
for the last 5 months of 1943, the program set forth below
and have prepared very detailed measures for realizing it:
In France—with the military commander, the German
Embassy, and the French Government; in Belgium—with the
<span class='pageno' title='492' id='Page_492'></span>
military commander; and in Holland with the offices of the
Reich Commissioner.</p>
<hr class='tbk583'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The program provides:</p>
<hr class='tbk584'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. In France the transfer of 1 million French workers, both
men and women, from the civilian to the German war
industries in France. This measure will enable further
considerable placing of German orders in France.</p>
<hr class='tbk585'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. Soliciting and recruiting of 500,000 French workers for
work in Germany. This figure should not be made known
publicly.</p>
<hr class='tbk586'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. In order to stalemate any passive resistance from large
groups of French officials, I have ordered, in agreement
with the military commander in France, the introduction
of labor recruiting commissions for each two French departments
and placed them under the supervision and direction
of the German Gau offices. Only in this manner can the complete
recruitment of the French labor potential and its intensive
utilization be made possible. The French Government has
given its approval.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>If the Tribunal will allow me, I shall quote the rest of this
letter; the following paragraphs concern Belgium and Holland. It
will allow me to refer to this document later without reading it
again:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“4. A program was secured in Belgium for the employment
of 150,000 workers in the Reich and, with the approval of the
military commander in Belgium, an organization for compulsory
labor corresponding to that in France was decided
upon.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I skip and proceed to the fifth paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“5. A program has likewise been prepared for Holland, providing
for the transfer of 150,000 workers to Germany and of
100,000 workers, men and women, from Dutch civilian
industries to German war production.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Such was Sauckel’s program in 1943. His plan was partly
thwarted by the resistance of officials and patriotic workers. Proof
of this is furnished by an admission of the defendant. I am
referring to the report on a conference of the central office for the
Four Year Plan held on 1 March 1944. I submitted this document
to the Tribunal yesterday as Exhibit Number RF-30 (Document
R-124). I shall read from the first page of the French translation,
second paragraph, German text, Page 1768:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Last autumn, as far as foreign manpower is concerned, the
labor recruiting program has been severely battered. I do
not wish to elaborate on the reasons here. They have been
<span class='pageno' title='493' id='Page_493'></span>
discussed at length; all I have to say is: The program has
been wrecked.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel, however, was not discouraged by the difficulties encountered
in 1943. In 1944 he attempted to realize a new program by
the trick of his fourth action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The National Socialist authorities decided to secure, in 1944,
the transfer of 4 million foreign workers to Germany. This decision
was made on 4 January 1944 during a conference at the headquarters
of the Führer and in his presence. The report on this
conference constitutes Document 1292-PS. I submit it herewith to
the Tribunal as Exhibit Number RF-68, and I read from Page 3 of
the French translation, Page 6 of the German original, last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Final results of the conference:</p>
<hr class='tbk587'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. The Plenipotentiary General for Allocation of Labor
shall procure at least 4 million new workers from the occupied
territories.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The details concerning the contingents demanded from each
occupied territory must have been determined on 16 February 1944,
during a conference of the central office for the Four Year Plan.
I submitted the report of this session at the outset of my explanations,
under Exhibit Number RF-20. I am quoting the conclusions
today. They will be found in Document Number F-675, first page
of the translation, third page of the German original.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Results of the 53rd session of the Central Planning Board.
Labor recruiting in 1944.</p>
<hr class='tbk588'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. About 500,000 new workers might be mobilized from
German home reserves by extraordinary efforts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I skip the rest.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Recruiting of Italian labor to the number of 1,500,000; of
these—1 million at the rate of 250,000 per month from January
to April and 500,000 from May to December;</p>
<hr class='tbk589'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. Recruiting of 1 million French workers at equal monthly
rates from 1 February to 31 December 1944 (approximately
91,000 per month);</p>
<hr class='tbk590'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4. Recruiting of 250,000 workers from Belgium;</p>
<hr class='tbk591'/>
<p class='noindent'>“5. Recruiting of 250,000 workers from the Netherlands.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I abstain from quoting since the other paragraphs concern the
Eastern European countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal has seen that France was called upon to furnish
a large contingent of workers. After the 15th of January, Sauckel
went to Paris to dictate his demands to the French authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fourth Sauckel action consisted of two distinct measures:
The adoption of the procedure known as the combing of industries,
<span class='pageno' title='494' id='Page_494'></span>
and the publication of the law of 1 February 1944, which widened
the sphere of application of compulsory labor. The system of combing
the industries led the labor administration to carry out direct
recruiting in the industrial enterprises. Mixed Franco-German
commissions were set up in each country. They determined the
percentage of workers to be deported. They proceeded to requisition
and transfer them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The practice of combing the industries represents the realization
of the projects elaborated by Defendant Sauckel as early as 1943.
In the documents which I have read to the Tribunal Sauckel
announced, in fact, his intention of creating mixed labor commissions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The law of 1 February 1944 marked the culminating point of
Sauckel’s actions in the field of legislation. It extends the scope of
application of the law of 4 September 1942. As from February 1944
all men between the ages of 16 and 60 and all women between the
ages of 18 and 45 were subject to compulsory labor. I submit to the
Tribunal the law of 1 February 1944 under Exhibit Number RF-69
(Document RF-69) with the request judicial notice be taken of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proof of the pressure that Sauckel exerted on the French
authorities in order to impose on them the publication of this law
is furnished by a report of the defendant to Hitler. This report is
dated 25 January 1944. It was, therefore, drafted during the
negotiations which characterized the fourth Sauckel action. It
constitutes Document 556(55)-PS, which I submit to the Tribunal
under Exhibit Number RF-70. I shall read this document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“My Führer:</p>
<hr class='tbk592'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On the 22d of January 1944 the French Government, together
with Marshal Pétain, accepted to a large degree my demands
for increasing the working week from 40 to 48 hours as well
as for extending the compulsory labor law in France and
utilizing French manpower in Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk593'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Marshal did not agree to the compulsory labor for
French women in the Reich; but he did agree to compulsory
labor for women inside France, limited to women between
the ages of 26 and 45. Women between 15 and 25 are to be
employed only at their place of residence.</p>
<hr class='tbk594'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Since this, nevertheless, represents appreciable progress in
comparison with the extremely difficult negotiations which I
had to conduct in Paris, I approved this law in order to save
further loss of time, on condition that the German demands
were energetically met and carried out.</p>
<hr class='tbk595'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The French Government has likewise accepted my demand
that French officials sabotaging the enforcement of the
<span class='pageno' title='495' id='Page_495'></span>
compulsory labor law should be punished by severe penalties
including the death penalty. I have left no doubt that
further and more rigid measures will be adopted if the
demands for the manpower required are not fulfilled.</p>
<hr class='tbk596'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Your ever obedient and faithful, Fritz Sauckel.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I draw the attention of the Tribunal to the problem of compulsory
labor of women referred to in the two preceding
documents. For a long time the French authorities categorically
opposed the introduction of female labor. In return the Defendant
Sauckel did not cease to exercise violent pressure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 27th of June 1943, in a letter to Hitler, he suggested
that an energetic statement of German needs be made before the
French Government. I have already quoted this letter to the
Tribunal, Exhibit Number RF-65 (Document 556(39)-PS). I shall not
revert to it, but I emphasize the fact that the law of 1 February
did not satisfy Sauckel and did not in the least appease his demands
at all. His dissatisfaction and his determination to pursue his policy
of compulsion become apparent from a report of 26 April 1944,
bearing his signature; that the report has been forwarded is certified
by Berk, one of his assistants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There actually were four reports submitted jointly under Document
Number 1289-PS, Exhibit Number RF-71, and I quote from
the second page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1) France. The problem of women.</p>
<hr class='tbk597'/>
<p class='noindent'>“At the time of the promulgation of the French compulsory labor
law, the French authorities (Marshal Pétain in particular)
have urgently desired that women be exempted from performing
compulsory labor in Germany. In spite of serious objections
the G.B.A. approved of this exemption. The reservation was
made, however, that the approval was given on condition that
the contingents imposed were met; or else the G.B.A. would
reserve himself the right of taking further measures. Inasmuch
as the contingents are far from being met, the demand for
extending the compulsory labor service to women must also
be addressed to the French Government.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The fourth Sauckel action, therefore, was led in such a manner
as to utilize all of France’s manpower. The French resistance and
the development of the military operations hindered the execution
of the Sauckel plan. The defendant, in the meantime, had contemplated
extraordinary measures to be taken on the day the allied
armies were to land. I quote again Document 1289-PS, Exhibit
Number RF-71; and I read on Page 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Measures concerning compulsory labor in the case of invasion:
<span class='pageno' title='496' id='Page_496'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk598'/>
<p class='noindent'>“To some extent precautions already have been taken to
evacuate the population of those areas invaded and to protect
valuable manpower from being seized by our enemies. In
view of the actual situation of labor utilization in Germany,
it is necessary to induct efficient workers to the greatest
extent possible into efficacious employment within the Reich.
Orders to this effect on the part of the Wehrmacht are
indispensable for carrying out these measures.</p>
<hr class='tbk599'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The following text might be proposed for an order by the
Führer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I shall not read the text of the order proposed by Sauckel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Allied victory, however, came so quickly that Sauckel did
not have the chance to realize fully his plan of mass deportation.
All the same, he started to carry it out, and deportations of workers
went on up to the day of liberation of the territory. Several hundred
thousand French workers were finally stationed in Germany as a
result of the various Sauckel actions. Will the Tribunal please bear
this in mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The compulsory labor service was introduced in Norway in the
same manner as in France. The defendants imposed upon the
Norwegian authorities the publication of a law instituting the
compulsory registration of Norwegian citizens, and prescribing
their enrollment by force. I quote in this respect the preliminary
report on the crimes of Germany against Norway, a report prepared
by the Norwegian Government and submitted to the Tribunal
as Document Number UK-79. I now submit it as Exhibit Number
RF-72, and I quote from the first page, third paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The result of Sauckel’s order as to Norway was that on 3
February 1943, a Quisling ‘law’ relating to compulsory
registration of Norwegian men and women for so-called
‘national labor effort’ was promulgated. Terboven and
Quisling openly admitted that the law was promulgated in
order that the Norwegian people should use their manpower
for the benefit of the German war effort. In a speech on 2
February Terboven stated, among other things, that he himself
and the German Reich stood behind this law; and he threatened
to use force against anyone who tried to prevent its
execution.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In Belgium and in the Netherlands the German authorities used
a direct procedure. The compulsory labor service was organized
by ordinances of the occupying power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Belgium these were ordinances of the military commander
and in the Netherlands ordinances of the Reich Commissioner. I
remind the Tribunal of the fact that the authority of the military
commander in Belgium extended to the north of France.
<span class='pageno' title='497' id='Page_497'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>An ordinance of 6 March 1942 established the principle of compulsory
labor in Belgium. It was published in the Belgian <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span>
of 1942, Page 845. I submit it to the Tribunal as Document
Number RF-73, and I ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice
of it. The ordinance of 6 March excluded the possibility of forced
deportation of workers to Germany. However, such deportation
was ordered by a decree of 6 October 1942, which was published
in the Belgian <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> of 1942, Page 1060. I submitted
it to the Tribunal as Document Number RF-57 in the course of
my explanations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These carryings-on in Belgium gave rise to interventions and
protests by leading Belgian personalities, among others the King
of Belgium and Cardinal Van Roay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ordinances instituting compulsory labor in Belgium and the
north of France bore the signature of General Von Falkenhausen,
but the latter proclaimed his ordinance of 6 October on the order
of Sauckel. I refer once more to the testimony of General Von
Falkenhausen, which I have submitted to the Tribunal as Document
Number RF-15. I ask your permission to quote the following
passages, first page, fifth paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘On 6 October 1942 a decree was published which
instituted compulsory labor in Belgium and in the departments
of northern France for men between the ages of
18 and 50 years and for single women from 21 to 25 years.’</p>
<hr class='tbk600'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘I was Commander-in-Chief for northern France and
Belgium.’</p>
<hr class='tbk601'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Does the witness recall having promulgated this decree?’</p>
<hr class='tbk602'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘I do not remember exactly the text of this decree
because it was issued following long arguments with the
labor deputy Sauckel.’</p>
<hr class='tbk603'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Did you have any trouble with Sauckel?’</p>
<hr class='tbk604'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘I was fundamentally opposed to the establishment of
compulsory labor, and consented to promulgating the decree
only after receiving orders.’</p>
<hr class='tbk605'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Then this decree was not issued on the initiative of
Von Falkenhausen himself?’</p>
<hr class='tbk606'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘On the contrary.’</p>
<hr class='tbk607'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Who gave instruction in this matter?’</p>
<hr class='tbk608'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘I suppose that at that time Sauckel was already
responsible for manpower and that at that time he gave me
all instructions on Hitler’s orders.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I skip and take up the quotation again on Page 3 of the French
translation, fourth paragraph:
<span class='pageno' title='498' id='Page_498'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Since you were opposed to the idea of compulsory labor,
didn’t you protest when you received these instructions?’</p>
<hr class='tbk609'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘There were unending quarrels between Sauckel and
myself. In the end this contributed greatly to my resignation.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The violence of the pressure exerted by the Defendant Sauckel
in Belgium in order to impose his plan of recruitment by force
is also demonstrated by the document which I have just submitted
to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number RF-67 (Document Number
556(43)-PS). The Tribunal will remember that it is the report
addressed on 13 August 1943 by Sauckel to Hitler on his return
from France, Belgium, and Holland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, I have to deal with the introduction of compulsory
labor in the Netherlands. I request the Tribunal to charge the
Defendant Seyss-Inquart as well as the Defendant Sauckel with
the institution of compulsory enrollment in the occupied Dutch
territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, the deportation of the Dutch workers was
organized by ordinances of the Reich Commissioner. They
established all the more the responsibility of the defendant, who
in his quality as Reich Commissioner, derived his powers directly
from the Führer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Seyss-Inquart introduced the compulsory labor
service in the Netherlands by an ordinance of 28 February 1941,
published in the Dutch <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> of 1941, Number 42. I
have referred to this ordinance as Document Number RF-58 in the
course of my explanation and asked the Tribunal to take judicial
notice of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As in Belgium the compulsory labor service could originally be
enforced in the interior of the occupied territories only; but just as
in Belgium, it was soon extended in order to permit the deportation
of workers to Germany. The extension was put into realization
by an ordinance of Seyss-Inquart of 23 March 1942, which appeared
in Number 26 of the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span>, 1942. I submit it to the
Tribunal as Document Number RF-74, and I ask the Tribunal to
add it to the Record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Seyss-Inquart has thus paved the way on which
the Defendant Sauckel was to be enabled to proceed to action.
Sauckel actually utilized all the human potential of the Netherlands.
New measures were soon necessary—measures which Seyss-Inquart
adopted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An ordinance dated 6 May 1943, <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span>, 1943, Page 173,
ordered the mobilization of all men from 18 to 35 years of age.
I submit this decree to the Tribunal as Document Number RF-75.
<span class='pageno' title='499' id='Page_499'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, as soon as 19 February 1943 Seyss-Inquart had issued
a regulation which permitted his services to take all measures in
the utilization of labor which they considered to be opportune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This ordinance, which appeared in the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> of 1943,
is submitted to the Tribunal as Document Number RF-76.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The extent of deportation from Holland in 1943 is attested to by
a letter of 16 June 1943 from Sauckel’s representative in the Netherlands.
This letter, which bears French Document Number F-664, is
submitted to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number RF-77. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In conformity with the census decree of 7 May 1943, the
1920 to 1924 classes have been registered on filing cards.
Although this involved very much work it was nevertheless
possible to send 22,986 workers to the Reich, and in addition
the prisoners of war put at our disposal. During the month
of June the deficiency of the month of May will be made up.</p>
<hr class='tbk610'/>
<p class='noindent'>“These classes include, according to the Statistical Service
of the Kingdom of Holland, 80,000 each. It is from these
classes that transfers to the Reich have been made so far. Up
to 1 June 1943, 446,493 persons have been transferred to the
Reich and a number of them have returned from there. The
figures as per index are as follows: 1921 class, 43,331; 1922
class, 45,354; 1923 class, 47,593; 1924 class, 45,232.</p>
<hr class='tbk611'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As up to 80 percent have been deferred, it is now imperative
to begin transporting entire classes to the Reich. The Reich
Commissioner has given his agreement to this action. The
other authorities involved—of economy, armament, agriculture,
and the Armed Forces—pressed by necessity, have
given their approval.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of the year 1944, the German authorities increased
their pressure on the Netherlands. During that period tens of
thousands of persons were arrested within 2 days in Rotterdam.
Systematic raids took place in all the larger cities of Holland, sometimes
improvised, sometimes after the population had been publicly
summoned to appear in designated places. I submit to the Tribunal
various proclamations of this kind. They form Document 1162-PS
and have already been submitted to the Tribunal by Mr. Dodd.
I shall not read them again. I use them in support of my argument
and submit them as Exhibit Number RF-78.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These documents do not reveal isolated facts; they show a
systematic policy which the defendants were to pursue up to
5 May 1945, when the capitulation of Germany brought liberation
to the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I still owe the Tribunal a supplementary explanation. The
defendants did not stop at introducing compulsory labor service
<span class='pageno' title='500' id='Page_500'></span>
in the occupied territories. I have said that they proceeded to
criminal coercion in order to ensure that the mobilization of foreign
workers was carried out. I am going to prove this fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The measures taken by the National Socialist authorities to
guarantee the forced enlistment of foreign workers cannot be disassociated
from the procedures they applied to ensure the so-called
voluntary enlistment. The pressure was more violent, but it sprang
from the same spirit. The method was to deceive, and where this
proved unsuccessful to use coercion. The defendants very soon
realized that no kind of propaganda would lend the cloak of
justice to compulsory labor in the eyes of their victims. If they
had any doubts in this respect, these would have been dissipated by
the reports of the occupation authorities. The latter were unanimous
in their reports of the political trouble provoked by this compulsory
enlistment and of the resistance encountered by it. That is why
the defendants once again used force in their attempt to ensure
that the civilian mobilization decreed by them was carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First in line among the coercive measures to which the Germans
took recourse, I mention the withholding of the ration cards of the
recalcitrants. The Tribunal knows from the circular letter of
Dr. Mansfeld, submitted as Exhibit Number RF-26 (Document
1183-PS), that this measure had been proposed ever since January
1942, and will recall that by decree of the Führer of 8 September
1942, which I submitted as Exhibit Number RF-55 (Document
556(2)-PS), this measure was put into effect. This order provided
that food and clothing ration cards were not to be issued to persons
incapable of proving that they were working, nor to those who
refused to do compulsory work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler’s order was put into effect in all occupied territories. In
France circulars imposing decrees by the occupation authorities
prohibited the renewal of ration cards of those French people who
had eluded the census of 16 February 1943. In Belgium the forfeiture
of ration certificates was regulated by an order of the military
commander. It is the order of 5 March 1943, published in the
<span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> for Belgium, which I submit to the Tribunal as
Document Number RF-79.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Von Falkenhausen, the signatory of this order, admitted
its grave significance during the interrogation, which I have submitted
to the Tribunal under Document Number RF-15 and to which
I refer again. General Von Falkenhausen declared that the Defendant
Sauckel was the originator of this order and that he had
refused to grant an amnesty proposed by his services. I quote, Page 4
of the French translation, fifth paragraph:
<span class='pageno' title='501' id='Page_501'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘Does the witness remember an order of 5 March 1943, by
which those refusing to enter the compulsory labor service
had their ration cards withdrawn?’</p>
<hr class='tbk612'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘I do not remember. At the time when the order was
issued for men from 18 to 50 years old the implementing
orders were not given by myself but by my offices, and I am
not conversant with the details of the application of reprisals.
I was not the executive head of the administration. I was
above it.’</p>
<hr class='tbk613'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘But at that time you were informed of the means of
pressure and manner of treatment which the authorities
thought fit to employ?’</p>
<hr class='tbk614'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘I do not wish to deny my responsibility for all that
happened. After all, I was aware of many things. I remember
in particular the order regarding ration cards, because on
various occasions I proposed that an amnesty be declared for
persons who were obliged to live illegally and who did not
have a ration card.’</p>
<hr class='tbk615'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘To whom was this proposal made?’</p>
<hr class='tbk616'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘To Sauckel, with the consent of President Revert.’</p>
<hr class='tbk617'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Q: ‘What was the attitude taken by Sauckel at that time?’</p>
<hr class='tbk618'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A: ‘He refused to grant such an amnesty.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In Holland, likewise, the renewal of ration certificates which did
not bear the stamp of the labor office was prohibited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defendants, however, used a method of coercion even more
criminal than the forfeiture of ration cards. I refer to the persecution
directed against the families of those who refused to do compulsory
labor. I call this method criminal, because it is based on the concept
of family responsibility which is contrary to the fundamental principles
of the penal law of civilized nations. It was, nevertheless,
sanctioned by several legislative texts issued or imposed by the
National Socialists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In France, I quote the law of 11 June 1943, which I submit to
the Tribunal as Document Number RF-80 with the request that it
take judicial notice thereof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Belgium, I refer to the order of the military commander of
30 April 1943, which appeared in the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> for Belgium
of 6 May 1943, and particularly to Paragraphs 8 and 9. I submit
this order to the Tribunal as Document Number RF-81, with the
request that it take judicial notice thereof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judicial action by the defendants was likewise directed against
the employers and against the officials of the employment bureaus.
In France the action was initiated by two laws of 1 February 1944.
<span class='pageno' title='502' id='Page_502'></span>
I emphasize that these laws were issued on the same day as the
compulsory labor law, and I affirm that they were imposed at the
same time. In support of my statement, I submit the admission of
the Defendant Sauckel, in his letter of 25 January 1944, which I
read a while ago to the Tribunal under Exhibit Number RF-70
(Document 556(55)-PS). I submit to the Tribunal the laws of
1 February 1944 as Document Number RF-82 with the request that
it be added to the Record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were still other measures of coercion. One of these, for
instance, was the closing of the faculties and schools to defaulting
students. It was decreed in Belgium on 28 June 1943; in France,
on 15 July 1943. In Holland the students were victims of a systematic
deportation in February and March 1943. I quote in this connection
a letter of 4 May 1943, which brings proof of the action carried out
through Holland towards a systematic deportation. This is Document
F-665, which I submit as Exhibit Number RF-83 of my book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps this is a good time to break off.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>M. HERZOG: Mr. President, Your Honors, at the suspension of
the session I was about to read to the Tribunal the letter of 4 May
1943, which gives evidence of the action taken in Holland towards
a systematic deportation of the students. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Subject: Action against students.</p>
<hr class='tbk619'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The action will start on Thursday morning. As it is now too
late to have this published in the press today, an announcement
by the Higher SS and Police Leader will be made over
the radio beginning tomorrow at 7 o’clock; it will be published
tomorrow in the morning and the evening papers. Besides
that, we will follow the directives given in yesterday’s
telegram.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Following is the text of the proclamation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Ordinance on the registration of students.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I will skip the first paragraph and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. All persons of the male sex who have attended a Dutch
university or academy during the years 1942-43 and have not
yet finished their studies according to the curriculum—referred
to below as ‘students’—are to report between 1000 and 1500
on 6 May 1943 to the commander of the sector of the SS and
the Security Police competent for their respective residence
for the purpose of their induction into the compulsory labor
service.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='503' id='Page_503'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I now skip Paragraphs 2 and 3 and quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“4. (1) Persons violating this ordinance or trying to circumvent
it, particularly such persons who do not comply with
their duty to register or either intentionally or through
negligence state any false data will be punished by imprisonment
and/or unlimited fine, unless other laws providing a
more severe penalty are applicable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk620'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(4) Those exercising paternal authority or guardianship over
the students are co-responsible for their reporting as prescribed.
They are subjected to the same penalties as the
offenders themselves.</p>
<hr class='tbk621'/>
<p class='noindent'>“5. This ordinance becomes effective on promulgation.”</p>
<hr class='tbk622'/>
<p class='noindent'>Signed—“The Higher SS and Police Leader with the
Reich Commissioner for the Occupied Dutch Territories.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Since no measures whatsoever succeeded in intimidating the
workers in the occupied territories, the defendants finally resorted
to their police forces to ensure the arrest of those workers destined
for deportation to Germany. This intervention by the police had
been demanded by the Defendant Sauckel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit two documents in evidence. The first consisted of the
minutes of a conference which took place on 4 January 1944 at the
headquarters of the Führer. I have just submitted this document to
the Tribunal as Exhibit Number RF-68 (Document 1292-PS). I quote,
French translation, Page 2, last paragraph; German original, middle
of Page 4:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Plenipotentiary General for Allocation of Labor (GBA)
Sauckel, declared that he would try with fanatical determination
to obtain this manpower. Up to now he had always
kept his promises regarding the number of workers to be
provided; with the best will in the world, however, he was
not in a position to make a definite promise for 1944. He
would do anything possible to provide the manpower required
for 1944. The success would depend mainly on the number
of German police put at his disposal. If he had to rely on
the indigenous police his project could not be carried out.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I refer now to the statements made by Sauckel at the conference
of the central office for the Four Year Plan on 1 March 1944. It is
Exhibit Number RF-30 (Document R-124), to which I repeatedly
have called the attention of the Tribunal. The passage which I am
about to quote has not yet been referred to before the Tribunal.
Page 3 of the French translation, German text, from Page 1775 on:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The term ‘S-factory’ ”—S-Betrieb—“in France is actually
nothing else but a protection against Sauckel’s grasp. That is
how the French look at it, and they certainly cannot be
<span class='pageno' title='504' id='Page_504'></span>
expected to think differently. They are Frenchmen in the
first place, who are faced with a German point of view and
German actions different from theirs. It is not up to me to
decide whether the protected factories (Schutzbetriebe) are
useful and necessary. I have described the situation only
from my point of view. Nevertheless, I still hope to succeed
eventually by using my old organization of agents on the
one hand and, on the other hand, by those measures which
I have fortunately been able to wrest from the French
Government.</p>
<hr class='tbk623'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In the course of negotiations lasting 5 to 6 hours I wrested
from M. Laval the concession that the death sentence may be
imposed on officials who sabotage the recruitment of labor
and other measures. Believe me, it was very difficult. I had
to fight hard to succeed, but I did succeed. And I am requesting,
especially of the Armed Forces that, in case the French
Government does not really put its mind to it, most drastic
action be taken now by the Germans in France. Please do
not resent my following remark: Several times, when in
company of my assistants, I have faced situations in France
which caused me to ask, ‘Is there no respect in France for
the German lieutenant and his 10 men?’ For months on end
everything I said was paralyzed by the reply, ‘What do you
want, Mr. Gauleiter? Don’t you know that we have no police
forces at our disposal? We are powerless in France.’</p>
<hr class='tbk624'/>
<p class='noindent'>“This was the reply given over and over again. How, in the
face of these facts, am I to achieve labor recruitment in
France? The German authorities must co-operate; and if the
French, despite all their promises, do not remedy the situation,
we Germans must make an example of one case and, on the
provisions of this law, put some prefect or mayor against the
wall if he does not co-operate, else not a single Frenchman
will go to Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>By such means the deportation of workers to Germany finally
was achieved, by arresting them, and by the threat of reprisals.
It was a logical consequence of the National Socialist system that
the policy of recruiting foreign workers was accomplished by police
terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have told the Tribunal that the resistance offered by the
prisoners of war and by the workers of the occupied territories
against the activities of the defendants, which were in turn insidious
and brutal, wrecked the plan for the recruitment of foreign workers.
The Defendant Sauckel encountered the greatest difficulty in carrying
out the programs which he had persuaded Hitler and the
Defendants Göring, Speer, and Funk to accept.
<span class='pageno' title='505' id='Page_505'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>From this it does not follow that Nazi Germany did not succeed
in carrying out mass deportations of foreign workers. The number
of native workers from the occupied territories of Western Europe
who were deported into Germany is very high. More numerous
still were those workers compelled to work at home in factories and
workyards under the control of the occupation authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall give the Tribunal statistical information which will
enable it to verify my statements. These statistics are fragmentary.
They are excerpts from reports compiled by the governments of the
occupied countries after their liberation and from reports sent
during the war by the Arbeitseinsatz office to its superiors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The statistics of Allied origin are incomplete. The records on
which they are based have been partially destroyed. On the other
hand, the administrations of the occupied territories are in possession
of second-hand information only whenever the requisitions
of workers were made directly by the occupation authorities. As
to the German statistics, they are also incomplete since the Allied
authorities have not yet discovered all the records of the enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, however, possible to give to the Tribunal an exact evaluation
of the extent of the deportations effected by Germany. This
evaluation will furnish proof that the violations of international law
committed by the defendants did not remain in the tentative stage
characterized by a beginning only—though reprehensible as such;
they brought about social disorder such as, under penal law, constitutes
the perpetration of the crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall first submit to the Tribunal the statistics furnished by
the official reports of the French Government. The French Government’s
report has been published by the Institute of Market
Analysis. It contains numerous statistical tables from which I quote
the total figures. The figures are as follows: 738,000 workers were
pressed into compulsory labor service in France; 875,952 French
workers were deported to German factories; 987,687 prisoners of
war were utilized for the Reich war economy. A total of 2,601,639
workers of French citizenship thus were pressed into work serving
the war effort of National Socialist Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the official report of the Belgian Government it appears
that 150,000 persons were pressed into compulsory labor; and the
report of the Dutch Government gives a figure of 431,400 persons;
but it should be noted that this figure does not take into account
the systematic raids undertaken during November 1944, nor the
deportations carried out in 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am submitting to the Tribunal exact figures which cover all
the stages of the policy of recruiting foreign labor. These figures
are taken from the reports of the Defendant Sauckel himself or of
<span class='pageno' title='506' id='Page_506'></span>
various administrative offices concerned with the deportation of
labor. The extent of labor utilized in the occupied territories is
demonstrated by the statistics concerning workers who were used
in constructing fortifications of the so-called Atlantic Wall as part
of the Organization Todt, which I recall was directed by the
Defendant Speer after the death of its founder. These statistics are
to be found in a teletype message sent to Hitler by the Defendant
Sauckel on 17 May 1943. It is Document 556(33)-PS, which I submit
to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number RF-84. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Delegate for the Four Year Plan. The Plenipotentiary
General for Allocation of Labor, Berlin, to the Führer, headquarters
of the Führer.</p>
<hr class='tbk625'/>
<p class='noindent'>“My Führer! I beg to submit to you the following figures on
the manpower employed in the Todt Organization:</p>
<hr class='tbk626'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In addition to the manpower assigned to the entire German
industry by the Allocation of Labor since I took office, fresh
workers have also been constantly supplied to the Todt Organization.
The total figure of the workers employed by the
Todt Organization was as follows: End of March 1942, 270,969;
end of March 1943, 696,003.</p>
<hr class='tbk627'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It should be noted that the Allocation of Labor has with
great speed and energy assigned workers preferably to the
Todt Organization in the West for the purpose of completing
the work on the Atlantic Wall. This is all the more remarkable
because in France, Belgium, and Holland.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I skip a few lines and quote from Page 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Despite the difficulties involved, the manpower strength of
the Todt Organization in the West was increased from 66,701
workers at the end of March 1942 to 248,200 workers at the
end of March 1943.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The number of foreign workers deported to Germany by
30 September 1941 is furnished by a report which was found in the
archives of the OKW. It is Document 1323-PS, which I submit as
Exhibit Number RF-85. According to this document, 1,228,686 foreign
workers were employed in Germany on 30 September 1941. Of that
number 483,842 came from the occupied Western territories. I quote
from this document the number of labor deportees by country of
origin. I shall confine myself to the columns of interest to the
Western states, since the statistics of workers deported from the
East of Europe come within the province of my Soviet colleagues:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Denmark, 63,309; Holland, 134,093; Belgium, 212,903; France,
72,475; Italy, 238,557.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='507' id='Page_507'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, on 7 July 1944, Sauckel, in one of his last reports,
informed the National Socialist Government of the results of his
campaign during the first half of 1944. I quote the document, which
bears the Number 208-PS and which I submit to the Tribunal as
Exhibit Number RF-86. I read from the second page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“C. The foreigners came from.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. France except the north,
33,000; Belgium, including the north of France, 16,000; Netherlands,
15,000; Italy, 37,000.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This is the fresh manpower put at the disposal of German industry
during the period of 1 January to 30 June 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have furnished the proof I owed to the Tribunal. The
Tribunal will, moreover, remember Sauckel’s admission at the 58th
conference of the Four Year Plan, which I have read to you previously.
Sauckel admitted that there were 5 million foreign workers
in Germany, of whom 200,000 were actually volunteers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The materiality of the crime exposed is at the same time
established by the circumstances of its perpetration and by the
multitude of the victims affected. To prove the gravity of its effect,
I have but to recall the treatment to which foreign workers were
subjected in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>German propaganda always claimed that foreign workers
deported to Germany were treated on equal basis with German
workers: the same living conditions, the same labor contracts, and
the same discipline. This contention, as such, is not conclusive. My
American colleagues have furnished proof of the blows which the
National Socialist conspirators have dealt to the dignity and decency
of the life of the German worker. The reality is worse yet. Foreign
workers did not enjoy the treatment in Germany to which they
were entitled as human beings. I affirm this and I will prove it to
the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before going into that I wish to call the Tribunal’s attention
to the significance of the new crime which I am denouncing. It does
not only make the crime of deportation complete but provides its
true meaning also. I said that the policy of the defendants in the
occupied territories could be summed up as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Utilization of the productive forces and extermination of the
unproductive forces. This is the principle representing one of the
favorite concepts of National Socialism, on the basis of which the
treatment inflicted on foreign workers by the defendants should be
judged. The Germans have exploited the human potential of the
occupied countries to the extreme limit of the strength of the
individuals concerned. They showed some consideration for foreign
workers only insofar as they wished to increase their output. But
<span class='pageno' title='508' id='Page_508'></span>
as soon as their capacity for work decreased, the foreign workers
shared the common lot of deportees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall prove my argument by expounding to the Tribunal the
working and living conditions and rules of discipline which were
imposed on foreign workers deported to Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I request the Tribunal to charge the Defendant Sauckel with the
facts I am going to denounce. He was put in charge of the working
conditions for foreign workers, following an agreement to which
he freely consented. The text of this agreement, made with Ley,
the Chief of the German Labor Front, on 2 June 1943, was
published in the <span class='it'>Reichsarbeitsblatt</span>, 1943, Part I, Page 558. I submitted
this to the Tribunal at the beginning of my presentation as
Exhibit Number RF-18.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This agreement shows that the treatment of foreign workers
was subject to control by the inspection department of the Allocation
of Labor (Arbeitseinsatz). The Defendant Sauckel could therefore
not ignore the mistreatment to which foreigners were
subjected. If not prescribed it was tolerated by him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The working conditions of workers deported to Germany
provided the first evidence of the determination of the defendants
to exploit the human potential of the occupied territories to the
extreme limit of its strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First I call the attention of the Tribunal to the working hours
imposed on foreign workers. The working hours were legally set at
54 hours per week by Sauckel’s decree of 22 August 1942. Actually,
most foreign workers were subjected to still longer working hours.
Rush work, which necessitated overtime, was mostly assigned to
foreigners. It was not unusual for the latter to be forced to work
11 hours a day, that is, 66 hours a week, provided they had one
day off per week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this purpose I quote the report of the Minister for Prisoners,
Deportees, and Refugees, Document UK-78(3), which I submit as
Exhibit Number RF-87. I quote Paragraph 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Working Hours: The average number of working hours was 11
and sometimes 13 a day in certain factories, for example,
Maschinenfabrik, Berlin (31). In Berlin-Spandau, the Alkett
factory imposed 10¼ hours work on day shift and 12 hours
on night shift. At Königsberg the caterpillar-tread factory,
Krupp, imposed 12 hours a day.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The work of foreign workers was remunerated by wages
identical with those of the German workers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I call the attention of the Tribunal to the illusory character of
this equality. The policy of freezing wages was a permanent
element of the wage and price policy pursued by the National
<span class='pageno' title='509' id='Page_509'></span>
Socialist Government; consequently, the wages of the workers
employed in Germany remained limited. They were, moreover,
heavily burdened with impositions and taxes. Finally and above
all, they were encroached upon by fines which the German
employers had the right to impose upon their workers. These fines
could reach the amount of the weekly wage for slight breaches of
discipline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit in evidence Document D-182. These are two drafts of
speeches to foreign civilian workers. One of them is intended for
Russian and Polish workers. I leave this to be dealt with by my
Soviet colleagues. I submit the other to the Tribunal as Exhibit
Number RF-88, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Draft of an address to foreign civilian workers, ‘Maintenance
of Labor Discipline,’ January 1944.</p>
<hr class='tbk628'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I must inform you of the following:</p>
<hr class='tbk629'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The increasing lack of punctuality and absenteeism have
caused the competent authorities to issue stricter regulations
to ensure labor discipline whereby the competence of the
employers to impose penalties has been extended. Violations
of labor discipline, such as repeated tardiness, being absent
without cause or excuse, leaving a job without authorization,
will in the future be punished by fines up to the average
daily wage. In more serious cases, for example, for repeated
absences without cause or excuse, or insubordination, fines
up to the average weekly salary will be imposed. In such
cases, moreover, the additional ration cards may be taken
away for a period up to 4 weeks.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The precariousness of wages which, after these various cuts,
were actually received by the foreign workers did not allow them
to raise their standard of living in the places to which they had
been deported. I maintain that this standard was insufficient and
that the attitude of the Arbeitseinsatz in this matter constitutes a
characteristic violation of the elementary principles of the rights of
man. I will confirm this by submitting to the Tribunal proof of the
inadequacy of food, lodging, and medical care to which the foreign
workers were entitled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German propaganda services issued, in France, illustrated
pamphlets in which the accommodations for foreign workers were
represented as being comfortable. It was quite different in reality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will not dwell on this point. Mr. Dodd, my American
colleague, has already submitted and commented upon Document
D-288, an affidavit by Dr. Jäger, chief medical officer in charge of
the work camps in the Krupp factories. I will not reread this
document to the Tribunal, but I would like to repeat that in this
<span class='pageno' title='510' id='Page_510'></span>
document Dr. Jäger stated that French workers—prisoners of war
working in the Krupp factories—had been billeted for more than
half a year in kennels, urinals, unused ovens. The kennels were
3 feet high, 9 feet long, and 6 feet wide, and the men had to sleep
there five in a kennel. I submit this document, which is to support
my argument, as Exhibit Number RF-89.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this unsanitary accommodation often inadequate food was
added. In this respect I wish to explain the following to the
Tribunal:</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not claim that the foreign workers deported to Germany
were systematically exposed to starvation, but I do maintain that
the leading principle of National Socialism finds its expression in
the food regulations for foreign workers. They were decently fed
only insofar as the Allocation of Labor wished to maintain or to
increase their capacity for work. They were put on a starvation
diet the moment when, for any reason whatsoever, their industrial
output diminished. They then entered that category of unproductive
forces, which National Socialism sought to destroy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 10 September 1942 the Defendant Sauckel declared to the
First Congress of the Labor Administration of Greater Germany:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Food and remuneration of foreign workers should be in
proportion to their output and their good will.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>He developed this point of view in documents which I am offering
in evidence to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I refer, in the first place, to the letter from Sauckel to Rosenberg,
which is Document 016-PS and which I shall not read since
it has already been read to the Tribunal by my American colleagues.
I wish, however, to draw the Tribunal’s attention to the second
paragraph, Page 20, of this document, which concerns the food
supply of prisoners of war and foreign workers:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“All these people must be fed, lodged, and treated in such
a way that they may be exploited to the maximum with a
minimum of expense.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I ask the Tribunal to remember this formula—the aim to exploit
the foreign labor to the maximum at a minimum of expense. It is
the same concept which I find in a letter of Sauckel of 14 March
1943 addressed to all Gauleiter. It is Document 633-PS, which
I submit to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number RF-90:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Subject: Treatment and care of foreign labor.</p>
<hr class='tbk630'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Not only our honor and prestige and, still more than that,
our National Socialist ideology which is opposed to the
methods of plutocrats and Bolshevists, but also cool common
sense in the first place demand proper treatment of foreign
labor, including even Soviet-Russians. Slaves who are
<span class='pageno' title='511' id='Page_511'></span>
underfed, diseased, resentful, despairing, and filled with hate,
will never yield that maximum of output which they might
achieve under normal conditions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I skip now to the next to the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“But since we will need foreign labor for many years and
the possibility of replacing them is very limited I cannot
exploit them on a short-term policy nor can I allow wasting
of their working capacity.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The criminal concept revealed by these documents is particularly
manifest in the establishment of the food sanctions which were
inflicted on the deported workers. I refer to Document D-182,
which I have just submitted as Exhibit Number RF-88, and I
remind the Tribunal that it provides the possibility of inflicting on
recalcitrant workers the penalty of a partial suppression of food
rations. Moreover, the foreign workers, who were all the more
exposed to diseases and epidemics since they were poorly lodged
and fed, did not enjoy proper medical care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit in evidence a report made on 15 June 1944 by
Dr. Février, head of the health service of the French Delegation
with the German Labor Front. It is Document F-536. I submit it
as Exhibit Number RF-91, and I quote from the last paragraph at
Page 15 of the French original, Page 13 of the German translation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At Auschwitz, in a very fine camp of 2,000 workers, we
find tubercular people who were recognized as such by the
local German doctor of the Arbeitsamt going about freely;
but this doctor neglects to repatriate them out of hostile
indifference. I am now taking steps to obtain their
repatriation.</p>
<hr class='tbk631'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In Berlin, in a clean hospital, well lighted and ventilated,
where the chief doctor, a German, makes the rounds only
once in 3 weeks, and a female Russian doctor every morning
distributes uniformly the same calming drops to every
patient, I have seen a dozen consumptives, three of them
released prisoners. All of them except one have gone beyond
the extreme limit at which treatment might still have had
some chance of proving effective.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>No statistics have been made of foreign workers who died
during their deportation. Professor Henri Dessaille, Medical
Inspector General of the Labor Ministry, estimates that 25,000
French workers died in Germany during their deportation. But not
all of them died of diseases. To slow extermination was added
swift extermination in concentration camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The disciplinary regime over the foreign workers was, in fact,
of a severity contrary to the rights of man. I have already given
<span class='pageno' title='512' id='Page_512'></span>
some example of penalties to which the deported workers were
exposed. There were still more. The workers who were deemed
recalcitrant by their supervisors were sent to special reprisal camps,
the ‘Straflager’; some disappeared in political concentration camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remind the Tribunal that I have already, indirectly, proved
this fact. In the course of my presentation I submitted under
Exhibit Number RF-44, the ordinance of Sauckel of 29 March 1943
which extends the term of the labor contracts by the length of
time which the workers spent in prison or in internment camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will not dwell on this point. Mr. Dodd, my American colleague,
has submitted to the Tribunal the documents which prove the
shipment of labor deportees to concentration camps. For the rest,
I take the liberty of referring the Tribunal to the presentation
which M. Dubost will deliver to the Tribunal within a few days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I emphasize, however, the significance of this persecution of
foreign workers. It constitutes the completion of the crime of their
deportation and the proof of the coherence of the German policy of
extermination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have already reported to the Tribunal the events which marked
the civilian mobilization of foreign workers for the service of
National Socialist Germany. I have shown how the device of
compulsory labor was inserted into the general framework of the
policy of German domination. I have denounced the methods
employed by the defendants to enforce the recruitment of foreign
labor. I have emphasized the importance of the deportations
undertaken by the Arbeitseinsatz, and I have recalled how the
deported workers were treated and ill-treated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The policy of compulsory labor includes all the infractions
under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal: Violation of international
conventions, violation of the rights of man, and crimes against
common law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the defendants bear functional responsibility for these
infractions. It was the Reich Cabinet which set up the principles
of the policy of enforced recruitment; the High Command of the
German Armed Forces carried them out in the workshops of the
Wehrmacht, the Navy, and the Air Force; the civilian administrations
made use of it to support the German war economy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I retain more particularly the guilt of certain of the defendants:
Göring, Plenipotentiary for the Four Year Plan, co-ordinated the
planning and the execution of the plans for the recruitment of
foreign workers. Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces,
counter-signatory of Hitler’s decrees, integrated compulsory labor
with his manpower policy. Funk, Reich Minister of Economics, and
Speer, Minister for Armament and War Production, based their
<span class='pageno' title='513' id='Page_513'></span>
program of war production on compulsory labor. Sauckel, finally,
Plenipotentiary General for Allocation of Labor, proved to be the
resolute and fanatical agent—to use his own words—of the policy
of compulsory enrollment which, in Holland, was promoted and
carried out by Seyss-Inquart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will appreciate their respective responsibility. I
request the Tribunal to condemn the crime of mobilization of
foreign workers. I ask the Tribunal to restore the dignity of human
labor which the defendants have attempted to degrade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. CHARLES GERTHOFFER (Assistant Prosecutor for the
French Republic): Mr. President, Your Honors, the French Prosecution
is in charge of the part of the Indictment concerning the
deeds charged to the defendants which were perpetrated in the
countries of Western Europe, as provided for by Article VI of the
Charter of 8 August 1945. This text provides for violations of the
laws and customs of war which concern persons on the one hand
and private and public property on the other hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The part of the Indictment concerning persons, that is, ill-treatment
inflicted on prisoners of war and on civilians, torture,
murder, deportation, as well as devastations not justified by military
exigencies, were presented to you and will be presented to you by
my colleagues. M. Delpech and I will have the honor to present to
you the pillage of private and public property.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will have to be informed of the most arid part
of the presentation of the French prosecution. We shall strive to
present it as briefly as possible, to shorten the quotation of the
numerous documents submitted to the Tribunal, and to avoid,
whenever possible, statistical material in order to bring only the
principal facts to light. Nevertheless, sometimes we will go into
detail in order that the Tribunal may appreciate certain characteristic
facts now charged to the defendants, facts which are customarily
designated as “economic looting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before approaching this subject, I should like to ask the Tribunal’s
permission to express the gratitude of the Prosecutors of
the Economic Section of the French Delegation to their colleagues of
the other Allied delegations, and particularly to those of the American
section of the economic case who have been kind enough to put at
our disposal a great number of German documents discovered by
the United States Army, and important material means for their
reproduction in a sufficient number of copies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall have the honor of presenting in succession to the
Tribunal: 1) General remarks on the economic looting of the
occupied countries of Western Europe, 2) the special case of Denmark,
3) that of Norway, 4) that of Holland. My colleague, M.
Delpech, will present 5), the part covering Belgium and the Grand
<span class='pageno' title='514' id='Page_514'></span>
Duchy of Luxembourg. I shall have the honor of presenting to you
6), the part relating to France, and also the conclusion. Finally, a
special statement, 7), will be devoted to the works of art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of the presentation, we shall submit a certain
number of documents. We shall quote only the passages which
seem to us the most important, when the same document relates
to several different questions; we shall quote those excerpts concerning
each question when it is presented, indicating each time
the reference in the document book, since it is impossible to make
known to you all the excerpts at the same time because of the
complexity of facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his speeches and in his writings, Hitler never concealed the
economic aims of the aggression of which Germany was to become
guilty. The theories of race and living space increased the envy
of the Germans at the same time as they stimulated their bellicose
instincts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After having conquered Austria and Czechoslovakia without
bloodshed, they turned against Poland and prepared to attack the
countries of Western Europe, where they hoped to find what was
lacking to assure their domination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This fact is revealed in particular by Document EC-606, discovered
by the United States Army, which I submit to the Tribunal
as Exhibit Number RF-92. This is the minutes of a conference
held by the Defendant Göring on 30 January 1940, with Lieutenant
Colonel Conrath and Director Lange of the machine-constructing
group attending. The following is the principal passage of the
minutes:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Field Marshal Göring told me at the beginning that he had
to inform me of the intentions of the Führer and of the
economic measures resulting therefrom.</p>
<hr class='tbk632'/>
<p class='noindent'>“He stated: The Führer is firmly convinced that he shall
succeed in bringing about a decisive conclusion of the war
in 1940 by making a great attack in the West. He assumes
that Belgium, Holland, and northern France will fall into
our possession; he, the Führer, forms his opinion on the
calculation that the industrial areas of Douai and Lens, of
Luxembourg, of Longwy and Briey might, as far as raw
materials are concerned, replace the deliveries from Sweden.</p>
<hr class='tbk633'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Therefore, the Führer has decided, in disregard for the
future, to stake fully our reserves of raw materials, at the
expense of possible later years of war. The soundness of
this resolution is supported with the Führer by the view
that the best stocks are not stocks of raw materials but stocks
of finished war materials. Moreover, when the aerial war
<span class='pageno' title='515' id='Page_515'></span>
begins, it must be taken into account that our finishing
factories may be destroyed. The Führer is furthermore of
the opinion that the maximum output must be achieved in
1940 and consequently that long-range production programs
should be put aside in order to accelerate those which can
be terminated in 1940.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>When the invasion began the countries of Western Europe were
glutted with products of every kind; but after 4 years of
methodical looting and enslavement of production, these countries
are ruined, and their entire population is physically weakened as
the result of rigorous restrictions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To achieve such results, the Germans used every method, particularly
violence, trickery, and blackmail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The purpose of the present statement will be to specify the main
spoliations ordered by the German leaders in the countries of
Western Europe and to show that they constitute, as far as they
are concerned, War Crimes which come under the jurisdiction of
the International Military Tribunal for major war criminals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not possible to draw an exact balance sheet of the German
looting and of the profit derived by them as the result of the
enslavement of production in the occupied countries. On one hand,
we do not have enough time; on the other hand, we find ourselves
faced with actual impotence resulting from the secret nature
of certain operations and the destruction of archives through acts
of war or deliberate destruction at the time of the German rout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, the documents now collected and the information
gathered make it possible to give a minimum estimate of the extent
of spoliation. However, I shall ask the Tribunal’s permission to
make three preliminary remarks:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1) The numerous acts of individual looting committed by the
Germans will not be referred to by this presentation since they
come under the competence of a different jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2) We shall only mention for the Record the incalculable, economic
results of German atrocities, for instance, the financial loss
experienced by the immediate relatives of breadwinners murdered,
or the loss suffered by certain victims of ill-treatment, who are
totally or partially, temporarily or permanently, incapacitated for
work, or the damage resulting from the destruction of localities
or buildings for the purpose of vengeance or intimidation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3) Finally, gentlemen, we shall not discuss the damage resulting
from purely military operations, which cannot be considered as
economic results of War Crimes. When damage caused by military
operations is referred to, some separate valuation will be necessary.
<span class='pageno' title='516' id='Page_516'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>With the permission of the Tribunal, I shall make a few general
remarks on the economic looting of Western European occupied
territories. Economic looting is to be understood as the removal
of wealth of every kind, as well as the enslavement of the production
of the various occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To reach such results in countries which were generally highly
industrialized and where numerous stocks of manufactured goods
and abundant reserves of agricultural products existed, the German
venture was faced with real difficulties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first, although the Germans had used this procedure to its
maximum extent, requisitions were not adequate. In fact, they had
to find the opportunities for ferreting out all sorts of things, which
were sometimes hidden by the inhabitants, and on the other hand,
they had to maintain for their own profit the economic activity
of these countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The simplest way of becoming masters of the distribution of
existing products and of production was to take possession of almost
all means of payment and, if necessary, to impose by force their
distribution in exchange for products or services, at the same time
combating the rise of prices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Faced with starvation the populations were thus naturally
forced to work directly or indirectly for the benefit of Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first part of this presentation will be divided into five
chapters: 1) Seizure of currency by the Germans; 2) sequestering
of the production of the occupied territories; 3) individual purchases,
which should not be confused with individual acts of looting;
4) the black market, organized by and for the profit of Germany;
5) examination of the question of economic looting from the viewpoint
of international law and in particular of the Hague Convention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First chapter—seizure of currency by the Germans:</p>

<p class='pindent'>To have at their disposal all means of payment, the Germans
used almost the same methods in the various occupied countries.
First, they took two principal measures. One was the issue of
paper money, by ordinance of 9 May 1940, published on Page 69
of the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt für die besetzten französischen Gebiete</span>,
official German gazette, which will subsequently be referred to by
its official abbreviation VOBIF, which I submit to the Tribunal as
Document Number RF-93. This ordinance concerned Denmark and
Norway; and on 19 May 1940 was rendered applicable to the
occupied territories of Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, and France.
<span class='pageno' title='517' id='Page_517'></span>
The Germans proceeded to issue bank notes of the Reichskreditkasse
which were legal tender only in the respective occupied
countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans then took a second measure: The blocking of
existing currency within the occupied countries as a result of the
ordinance of 10 May 1940, published in VOBIF, Page 58, which I
submit as Document Number RF-94. In regard to Holland these
ordinances are those of 24 June, 14 August, 16 August, and 18 September
1940, which are submitted as Document Numbers RF-95,
96, 97, and 98. In regard to Belgium these ordinances are those of
17 June and 22 July 1940, submitted as Document Numbers
RF-99 and 100.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These measures, notably the issuing of paper money, left
exclusively to the whim of the Germans without any possible
control on the part of the financial administrations of the occupied
countries, were to serve, as we shall see, as powerful means of
pressure to impose the payment of enormous war tributes under
the pretext of maintaining occupation troops as well as alleged
payment agreements known as “clearing,” which functioned almost
exclusively to the benefit of the occupying power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans thus procured for themselves, under false
pretenses, means of payment from which they profited by realizing
considerable sums for their sole benefit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All agricultural and industrial products, raw materials, goods
of every kind, or services, for which Germany apparently made
regular payment by means of either notes of the Reichskreditkasse
or by so-called clearing agreements or by war tributes known as
indemnities for the maintenance of occupation troops, were exacted
with full knowledge that no redemption would be forthcoming.
Thus, we can be sure that, as a rule, such regulations were purely
fictitious and were the most regularly used fraudulent procedure
to effect the economic looting of the occupied countries of Western
Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These questions will be examined in a more exact manner later
on. I shall limit myself for the moment to pointing out to the
Tribunal that to effect the economic looting of the occupied countries
with their own money, it was necessary that this money
should preserve an appreciable purchasing power. Therefore, the
efforts of the Germans were directed toward stabilization of prices.
A severe regulation prohibiting rises in prices was subsequently
promulgated by several decrees—VOBIF, Pages 8, 60, and 535,
submitted as Document Number RF-101. Nevertheless, the application
of such measures could not prevent economic laws from
<span class='pageno' title='518' id='Page_518'></span>
playing their part. The payment of excessive tributes, considering
the resources of the invaded countries, could not but have as their
primary result a continuous rise of prices. The leaders of the Reich
were perfectly aware of the situation and watched very attentively
the rise in prices, which they were attempting to moderate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This we know principally from the secret reports of Hemmen,
President of the Armistice Commission for German Economic
Questions, which we will discuss when we examine the particular
case of France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chapter 2—Sequestering of the production of the occupied
countries:</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Germans invaded the countries of Western Europe
great disorder was created as the result. The population fled before
the advance of the enemy. Industries were at a stand-still. German
troops guarded the factories and prevented anyone from entering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am not able to give you a list of the enterprises affected by
this situation, since there was almost no exception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, as an example, we will present to the Tribunal the
original of one of the numerous posters exhibited in industrial
plants in France. I submit this poster as Document Number
RF-102. It is dated Paris, 28 June 1940. One text is in German,
and the other is in French. Here is the French text:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“By order of General Field Marshal Göring of 28 June 1940,
the Generalluftzeugmeister took possession of this factory as
trustee. Only persons having special permits from the
Generalluftzeugmeister, Verbindungsstelle, Paris, may enter.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hardly had the factories been occupied by the military when
German technicians, at the heel of the troops, proceeded methodically
to remove the best machines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is revealed by a secret report of Colonel Hedler, dated
December 1940 and emanating from the Economic Section of the
OKW, Pages 77 and 78, that the removal of the best machines
from the occupied territories was to be organized, in spite of the
terms of Article 53 of the Hague Convention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document is submitted as Exhibit Number RF-103 (Document
EC-84).</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, immediately after the invasion, the working
population, their resources being exhausted, naturally gravitated
around these factories in the hope of securing their means of
subsistence. Problems of an identical nature arose in all the
occupied countries: to stop the looting of machinery, which was
taking place at an alarming rate; and to keep the workers
employed.
<span class='pageno' title='519' id='Page_519'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans for their part forced the factories to resume work
under the pretext of assuring subsistence to the population. The
ordinance of 20 May 1940, published in the VOBIF, Page 31, which
we submit as Document Number RF-104, applicable to the Netherlands,
Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, orders that work should
be resumed in all enterprises and industries of food supply and
agriculture. The same text provided for the appointment of
temporary administrators in case of absence of the directors or in
other cases of emergency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are there any objections to breaking off?</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 21 January 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='520' id='Page_520'></span><h1>THIRTY-NINTH DAY<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>Monday, 21 January 1946</span></h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: Mr. President, Your Honors, at the end of the
last session I had the honor of beginning the account of the French
Prosecution on the economic pillage. In the first chapter I had
indicated to you succinctly how the Germans had become masters
of the means of payment in the occupied countries by imposing war
tributes under the pretext of maintaining their army of occupation
and by imposing so-called clearing agreements, functioning to their
benefit almost exclusively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a second chapter, entitled “Sequestering of Production in the
Occupied Territories,” I had the honor of expounding to you that,
after the invasion, the factories were under military guard and that
German technicians proceeded to transfer the best machines to the
Reich; that the working population, having come to the end of their
resources, grouped themselves around the factories to ask for
subsidies; and, finally, that the Germans had ordered the resumption
of work and had reserved for themselves the right to designate
provisional administrators to direct the enterprises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same time, the Germans exercised pressure over the rulers
of the occupied countries and over the industrialists to bring the
factories back to productivity. In certain cases they themselves
placed provisional German administrators in charge and insinuated
that the factories would be utilized for the needs of the occupied
populations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the whole, to avoid unemployment and to maintain their
means of production, the industrialists, little by little, resumed their
work, endeavoring to specialize in the manufacture of objects
destined for the civilian populations. Resorting to various means
of pressure, the Germans imposed the manufacture of defensive
armaments and then progressively of offensive armaments. They
requisitioned certain enterprises, shut down those which they did
not consider essential, distributed the raw materials themselves, and
placed controllers in the factories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German control and seizure continually expanded in conformity
with secret directives given by the Defendant Göring
himself, as can be seen in a document dated 2 August 1940, discovered
by the Army of the United States, which bears the Document
Number EC-137, and which I place before the Tribunal as
<span class='pageno' title='521' id='Page_521'></span>
Exhibit Number RF-105. This is the essential passage of the
document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The extension of the German influence over foreign enterprises
is an objective of German political economy. It is not
yet possible to determine whether and to what extent the
peace treaty will effect the surrender of shares. It is now,
however, that every opportunity should be used for German
economy, in time of war, to obtain access to material of
interest to the economy in occupied territories and to prevent
removals that might hinder the realization of the above-mentioned
aim.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I stop this quotation here. After having had knowledge of such
a document, there can be no further doubt about the intentions of
the German rulers. The proof of the putting into execution of such
a plan is shown in a document which will be read when the particular
case of France will be dealt with in the course of this
exposé.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will be informed about a study of a certain
Michel, Chief of the Administrative General Staff on Economic
Questions, deputy to the German commanding officer in France,
which brings out the extent of the dictatorship of the Reich over
the occupied countries in economic matters. The control of the
enterprises in occupied countries was assured by civil or military
officials who were on the spot and also, later on, by similar German
enterprises, which had become their “Paten-Firma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To give an example of this economic domination, here are the
orders received by an important French company. This involves the
Thomson-Houston Company, and I present a letter to the Tribunal
under Document Number RF-106 in the French documentation,
which is addressed to this establishment. It is dated Paris,
8 October 1943.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Société des Procédés Thomson-Houston, 173 Boulevard Haussmann,
Paris.</p>
<hr class='tbk634'/>
<p class='noindent'>“You are fully responsible for the punctual, careful, and
reasonable filling of the German orders which are passed to
you, both as regards the giver of the order and my office,
which is the competent agency for all orders given to France.</p>
<hr class='tbk635'/>
<p class='noindent'>“To facilitate for you the execution of your obligations, the
firm of the Allgemeine Elektricitäts Gesellschaft, Berlin
(NW 40), Friederich-Karl-Ufer 2-4, is designated by me as
the ‘Paten-Firma.’ I attach the greatest importance to close
collaboration on technical matters with the above-mentioned
firm. The Paten-Firma will have the following functions:</p>
<hr class='tbk636'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1) To co-operate in the establishment of your production
plan to utilize your capacities;
<span class='pageno' title='522' id='Page_522'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk637'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2) To be at your disposal for all technical advice which you
may need, and to exchange information with you;</p>
<hr class='tbk638'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3) To serve as an intermediary, if need be, for negotiations
with German authorities;</p>
<hr class='tbk639'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4) To keep me informed as to anything that might occur
which might prevent or limit the fulfillment of your
obligations.</p>
<hr class='tbk640'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In view of assuring these tasks, the Paten-Firma is authorized
to delegate a Firmenbeauftragter to your firm, and when
necessary, technical engineers from other German firms who
may have handed you important orders.</p>
<hr class='tbk641'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In order to permit the Paten-Firma to accomplish its task
it will be necessary to give the firm or its Firmenbeauftragter
the necessary information on everything that relates to the
German orders and to their execution:</p>
<hr class='tbk642'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1) By placing at its disposal your correspondence with your
supply houses and with your subcontractors;</p>
<hr class='tbk643'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2) By informing it now of the extent to which the capacities
of your factories are being utilized and permitting it to check
on the production;</p>
<hr class='tbk644'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3) By letting it take part in your conferences and see your
correspondence with the German authorities.</p>
<hr class='tbk645'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It is your duty to inform the Paten-Firma or their Firmenbeauftragter
immediately about any orders which you may
receive.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is the end of the quotation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost all the important enterprises in the occupied territories
were thus placed under the control of German firms, with the
double aim of favoring the Reich’s war effort and of achieving by
progressive absorption an economic preponderance in Europe, even
in case of a peace by compromise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the agricultural sphere the Germans used similar means of
pressure. They made wholesale requisitions of products, leaving the
population with quantities clearly insufficient to assure their
subsistence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now take up the third chapter devoted to individual purchases
by the German military or civilian forces in the occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the present statement cannot take up individual acts of pillage
or the numerous thefts committed in the occupied countries, it is
important nevertheless to mention the individual purchases, these
having been organized methodically by the German rulers to benefit
their own nationals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the beginning of the occupation the soldiers or civilians
effected purchases by means of vouchers of doubtful authenticity
<span class='pageno' title='523' id='Page_523'></span>
which had been handed them by their superiors. Soon, however,
the Germans had at their disposal a sufficient quantity of money
to allow them to purchase without any kind of rationing, or by
means of special vouchers, considerable quantities of agricultural
produce or of objects of all kinds, notably textiles, shoes, furs,
leather goods, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>. Thus, for instance, certain shoe stores were
obliged to sell every week, in exchange for special German vouchers,
300 pairs of men’s, women’s, or children’s shoes for town wear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is indicated in an important report of the French economic
control, to which I will have occasion to refer several times in the
course of this presentation and which I submit to the Tribunal
under Document Number RF-107.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The individual purchases which constitute a form of economic
pillage were, I repeat, not only authorized but organized by the
German rulers. In fact, when the Germans returned to their
country they were encumbered by voluminous baggage. A postal
parcel service had been created by the Germans for the benefit
of their nationals living in the occupied countries. The objects were
wrapped in a special kind of paper and provided with seals that
enabled their entry, duty free, into Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to get an idea of the volume of individual purchases,
it is important to refer to the declarations of one Murdel, ex-director
of the Reichskreditkasse at present detained in Paris, who
was heard before an examining magistrate of the Cour de Justice
de la Seine on 29 October 1945. This is the declaration made by
Murdel on the subject of individual purchases, and I submit it in
evidence as Document Number RF-108.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The judge asked Murdel the following question:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“What were the needs of the army of occupation? What
purchases did you have to make on its account?”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Murdel answered:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is impossible for me to answer the first part of the
question. I had tried during the occupation to obtain information
on this point, but it was objected that this was a
military secret which I had no right to know. What I can
tell you is that we settled the pay of the troops and that
a private earned from 50 to 60 marks, a noncommissioned
officer 50 percent more, and an officer considerably more,
naturally. I have no idea what forces the occupation army
may have included, as these forces were extremely variable.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I skip a few lines to make this shorter. Murdel adds:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Apart from this, every soldier on leave returning from
Germany had the right to bring back with him a certain
number of marks (50). The same was the case for any
German soldier who was stationed for the first time in
<span class='pageno' title='524' id='Page_524'></span>
France. We exchanged the marks into French francs. I value
the total of the sum that we paid out each month in this way
at 5,000 million francs.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>One may thus estimate at about 250,000 million francs, at least,
the individual expense incurred in France by the Germans, of which
amount the greater part was used for the purchase of products and
objects sent to Germany, to the detriment of the French population.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To show the size of these costs, I would add that the amount of
5,000 million francs a month, in other words 60,000 million francs
a year, is greater than the budget receipts of the French State in
1938, for these were only 54,000 million francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After having viewed the individual purchases, I shall enter upon
a fourth chapter devoted to the organization of the black market
by the Germans in the occupied territories. The population of the
occupied countries had been subjected to a severe rationing of products
of all kinds. They had been left only obviously insufficient
quantities for their own vital needs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These regulations made available a large quantity of the stock
production which the Germans seized by means of operations that
were, to all appearances, regular: requisitions, purchases by official
services, individual purchases, or those in exchange for vouchers of
German priority. We have just seen that these purchases represented
for France, alone, an average of 5,000 million francs per month.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But such regulations produced, as a corollary, a depletion of
merchandise and the concealment of products with the aim of keeping
them from the Germans. This state of affairs gave birth, in
the occupied countries, to what was called the black market, that
is to say, clandestine purchases made in violation of regulations
on rationing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans themselves were not slow in proceeding, to an
ever greater extent, to purchase on the black market, mostly through
agents and sub-agents, recruited among the most doubtful elements
of the population, whose work was to find out where these products
could be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These agents, compromised by violations of the legislation on
rationing which they had committed, enjoyed absolute immunity;
but they were constantly under the threat of denunciation on the
part of their German employers in case they should slow up or stop
their activity. Often these agents also fulfilled functions for the
Gestapo and were paid by commissions, which they obtained in
black market transactions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The different German organizations in the occupied countries fell
into the habit of making clandestine purchases that became increasingly
important in volume. Indeed, they began to compete
among themselves for this merchandise, the chief result of which
<span class='pageno' title='525' id='Page_525'></span>
was to increase the prices, thus threatening to bring about inflation.
The Germans, while they continued to profit by the clandestine
purchases, were anxious that the money which they used should
maintain as high a value as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To obviate such a situation, the rulers of the Reich decided in
June 1942 to organize purchases on the black market methodically.
Thus the Defendant Göring, the Delegate of the Four Year Plan,
gave to Colonel Veltjens, on 13 June 1942, the mission of centralizing
the structure of the black market in the occupied countries. This
fact emerges from several documents discovered by the Army of the
United States, of which I submit the first to you as Document Number
RF-109. It is the nomination of Colonel Veltjens, signed by the
Defendant Göring himself. I do not want to take up the time of
the Tribunal in giving a complete reading of these documents.
I think that they cannot be contested, but if this should occur later,
I will reserve for myself the privilege of reading them later, unless
the Tribunal would prefer me to read them immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am afraid we must adhere to our ruling.
The documents which we cannot take judicial notice of must be
read if they are to be put in evidence. You need only read the
portions of the document which you require to put in evidence—not
necessarily the formal parts, but the substantial parts which you
require for the purpose of your proof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: This is the letter of 13 June 1942, signed by
the Defendant Göring.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Owing to the simultaneous purchases of goods by the
different branches of the Wehrmacht and other organizations
on the so-called black market, a situation has developed in
some occupied territories which hampers the methodical
exploitation of these countries for the needs of German war
economy, is also harmful to German prestige, and endangers
the discipline necessary in the military and civilian administration.
This deplorable state of things can no longer be
tolerated. I therefore charge you to regularize these commercial
transactions in agreement with the services that are
involved and, particularly, with the chiefs of the administration
of the occupied territories. In principle, commercial
transactions in the occupied territories that are made outside
the framework of the normal provisioning, or constituting a
violation of price regulations, must be limited to special cases
and can be carried out only with your previously given assent.
I approve your proposal that only to trading companies controlled
by the Reich should be assigned the handling of these
goods, in the first place the ‘Roges.’
<span class='pageno' title='526' id='Page_526'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk646'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I beg you to submit, at the earliest possible date, a detailed
plan of operation for starting your activity in Holland, Belgium,
France, and Serbia. (In Serbia it is Consul General Neuhausen
who is to be in charge.) This plan must include the
seizure of port installations and machinery and tools of enterprises
to be closed down in the occupied territories. As to the
results of your work, I beg you to submit a report to me
every month through my representative; the first to be sent
on 1 July 1942.</p>
<hr class='tbk647'/>
<p class='noindent'>“If necessary, the Central Planning Board will decide as to
the distribution of merchandise thus purchased.”—Signed—“Göring.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thereupon, on 4 September 1942, the Defendant Göring had given
orders for the complete collection of all merchandise of use, even
if signs of inflation should result from this act, in the occupied
territories. This is shown by a report signed “Wiehl,” concerning
the utilization of funds derived from occupation costs. I submit this
to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number RF-110 (Document Number
1766-PS).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after, on 4 October 1942, the Defendant Göring made a
speech on the occasion of the Harvest Festival, a speech that is
reported in <span class='it'>Das Archiv</span> of October 1942, Number 103, Page 645.
In this speech the Defendant Göring stated implicitly that he meant
purchases on the black market in the occupied countries to continue
for the benefit of the German population. I submit a copy of this
article as Document Number RF-111 and I quote from it the following
passage:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have examined with very special care the situation in the
occupied countries. I have seen how the people lived in Holland,
in Belgium, in France, in Norway, in Poland, and
wherever else we set foot. I have noticed that although very
often their propaganda speaks officially of the difficulty of
their food situation, in point of fact this is far from being the
case. Of course everywhere, even in France, the system of
ration cards has been introduced; but what is obtained on
these ration cards is but a supplement, and people live normally
on illegal commerce.</p>
<hr class='tbk648'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The recognition of this has caused me to make a firm
decision, creating a principle which must be rigidly adhered
to. The German people must be considered before all others
in the battle against hunger and in the problem of food
supply. It is my desire that the population of the territories
which have been conquered by us and taken under our protection
shall not suffer from hunger. If, however, through
enemy measures difficulties of food supply should arise, then
<span class='pageno' title='527' id='Page_527'></span>
all must know that if there is to be hunger anywhere it
shall in no case be in Germany.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The United States Army has discovered a secret report, made on
15 January 1943, by Colonel Veltjens, in which he gives an account
of his activity over a period of 6 months to the Defendant Göring.
This is Document Number 1765-PS, which I submit now to the
Tribunal as Exhibit Number RF-112. It is not possible for me to
give a complete reading of this report. I shall simply read certain
passages of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first part of his report Veltjens explains the reasons for the
rise of the black market in these terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1) The reduction in merchandise as a result of the regulations
and rationing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk649'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2) The impossibility of stabilizing prices.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk650'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3) The impossibility of price control on German lines owing
to lack of personnel in the German control organizations.</p>
<hr class='tbk651'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4) The neglect of practical support for counter-measures on
the part of the local administrative authorities, especially
in France.</p>
<hr class='tbk652'/>
<p class='noindent'>“5) The half-hearted penal justice of the local judiciary
authorities.</p>
<hr class='tbk653'/>
<p class='noindent'>“6) The lack of discipline of the civilian population.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>
<hr class='tbk654'/>
<p class='noindent'>Then under the same number 6), a little further, Veltjens indicates:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The activity of the German services on the black market
grew little by little to such an extent that more and more
unbearable situations arose. It was known that the black
market operators offered their merchandise to several bureaus
at the same time and that it was the one which gave the
highest price who obtained the merchandise. Thus, the
different German formations not only vied with each other
in obtaining the merchandise, but also they caused the prices
to rise.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Further on in his report, Veltjens indicates that he has assumed
the direction of the service created by the Delegate for the Four
Year Plan in these terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Finally, in June 1942, in agreement with all the central services,
the delegates for the special missions (B. f. S.) were
charged with taking in hand the seizure and the central control
of the black market. Thus, for the first time, a necessary
preliminary condition was created for effectively dealing with
the problem of the black market.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the second part of his report, Veltjens explains the advantages
of the organization in charge of which he was placed and he writes,
among other things:
<span class='pageno' title='528' id='Page_528'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It has been stated that purchases on the black market in
their present volume would become in the long run too much
for the budget of the Reich. In answer to this it must be pointed
out that the greater part of the purchases were made in
France and were financed by occupation costs. Out of a total
of purchases amounting to 1,107,792,819 RM, the sum of
929,100,000 RM was charged to the French for occupation costs
so that the Reich budget was not involved for that amount.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>After having indicated the inconveniences of the black market, Veltjens
concludes:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In recapitulating”—writes Veltjens—“it must be stated that,
in view of the supply situation in the Reich, now as before
we cannot do without black market purchases as long as there
are still hidden stocks which are important for carrying on
the war. To this vital interest all other considerations must
be subordinated.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a third part of this same report, Veltjens deals with the
technical organization of his offices. Here are some interesting
passages:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The general direction and supervision of the purchases is the
task assigned to the control services which have been newly
created for this purpose, as follows:</p>
<hr class='tbk655'/>
<p class='noindent'>“a) Supervisory service in France, with headquarters in Paris;</p>
<hr class='tbk656'/>
<p class='noindent'>“b) supervisory service in Belgium and the North of France,
with headquarters in Brussels;</p>
<hr class='tbk657'/>
<p class='noindent'>“c) supervisory service in Belgium and in the North of
France, auxiliary service Lille, with headquarters in Lille;</p>
<hr class='tbk658'/>
<p class='noindent'>“d) supervisory service in Holland with headquarters in The
Hague;</p>
<hr class='tbk659'/>
<p class='noindent'>“e) supervisory service in Serbia with headquarters in Belgrade.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then Veltjens tells us that purchases themselves were carried
out by a restricted number of licensed purchasing organizations,
that is, 11 for France, 6 for Belgium, 6 for Holland, 3 for Serbia.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“So”—he writes—“all the purchases are subject to the central
control of the delegate for the special missions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Further on Veltjens adds:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The financing of the purchases and the transport of merchandise
are to be carried out by the Reich-owned Roges m. b. H.
The merchandise is then to be distributed to the purchasers
in the Reich by Roges in accordance with instructions from
the Central Planning Board, or departments appointed by the
Central Planning Board and in order of urgency.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='529' id='Page_529'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the fourth section of his report Veltjens gives the volume of
the operations carried out up to the date of 30 November 1942,
that is to say, in less than 5 months, as his organization had not
begun its activity before 1 July 1942. Here are the figures that
Veltjens gives:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The volume of purchases made (up to 30 November 1942):</p>
<hr class='tbk660'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(a) Since the inauguration of the purchases directed by the
German commanders or the Reich Commissioner, and of the
directed distribution of merchandise in the Reich, there has
been purchased a total of 1,107,792,818.64 Reichsmark: In
France a total amount of 929,100,000 Reichsmark; in Belgium
103,881,929 Reichsmark; in Holland 73,685,162.64 Reichsmark;
and in Serbia 1,125,727 Reichsmark.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Veltjens adds:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The payment in France is made from the account of the occupation
costs, and in the other countries by means of clearing.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then Veltjens gives a table of merchandise purchased in this way
over the period of these 5 months. I shall simply give a summary to
the Tribunal:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1) Metals, 66,202 tons valued at 273,078,287 Reichsmark; 2)
textiles, a total value of 439,040,000 Reichsmark; 3) leather,
skins, and hides to a total value of 120,754,000 Reichsmark.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Veltjens adds:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Further purchases comprised: Industrial oils and fats, edible
oils and fats, wool, household articles, mess articles, wines
and spirits, engineering equipment, medical articles, sacks,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Veltjens then gives a table of the increase in prices during these
5 months. Then he states the principle that the black market must
be utilized solely to the benefit of Germany and be severely
repressed when it is utilized by the populations of the occupied
countries. On this subject he actually writes:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Extension of price control. As an increase of the personnel
of the German controlling offices may not be possible, or
may be possible only to a limited extent, it will be necessary
to obtain from the local administration authorities greater
activity in this respect.</p>
<hr class='tbk661'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. Application of severe penalties, on German lines, for
violations of regulations. This is the only means of remedying
the lack of discipline among the civilian populations, arising
from their individual and liberal ideas. A check of the sentences
that have been passed by the local tribunals is to be recommended.
<span class='pageno' title='530' id='Page_530'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk662'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. The promise of rewards for denouncing violations of the
rationing regulations, equivalent to a high percentage of the
value of the goods seized on account of the denunciation.</p>
<hr class='tbk663'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4. The hiring of informers and of agents provocateurs.</p>
<hr class='tbk664'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Further to hinder illegal production:</p>
<hr class='tbk665'/>
<p class='noindent'>“5. Closing of all enterprises that are not working for the
war industry.</p>
<hr class='tbk666'/>
<p class='noindent'>“6. Closing or merging of enterprises whose capacity or production
is being only partly exploited.</p>
<hr class='tbk667'/>
<p class='noindent'>“7. Closer control of the productivity of factories.</p>
<hr class='tbk668'/>
<p class='noindent'>“8. Close examination of the quantity of raw materials allotted
for the German orders placed in France.</p>
<hr class='tbk669'/>
<p class='noindent'>“9. A policy of prices which affords the enterprises adequate
profit and thus guarantees their means of existence.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Examining the demands of the rulers of the occupied countries
with relation to the German purchases on the black market, Veltjens
writes:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Moreover, lately the French and Belgian economic and
government circles, among others the Chief of the French
Government himself, have considered it necessary to complain
about the organized German buying. In response to remonstrations
of this kind, it should be pointed out—in addition to
various other arguments—that on the part of the Germans,
too, there is naturally the greatest interest in the disappearance
of the black market. But the chief responsibility for its
existence rests with the government authorities themselves
for their incompetence regarding price control and their
negligence in meting out just punishment, whereby lack of
discipline among their own population is encouraged.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will allow me to stress the value of the argument
developed by Veltjens by reminding it that the Germans were the
principal purchasers on the black market, and that their agents
enjoyed absolute immunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, speaking of the machinery in the factories, Veltjens
writes in his report:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Another order of the delegate for the special missions concerns
seizure of the machinery of closed factories. It is an
established fact that great capacities, particularly of machine
tools, are not being utilized at present, while at home they
are urgently needed for armament production. After an
agreement by the delegate of special missions, the military
commander, and the plenipotentiary for machine production,
there has been created in France, at the armament inspection
<span class='pageno' title='531' id='Page_531'></span>
office, an office for the distribution of machines (Maschinenausgleichstelle).</p>
<hr class='tbk670'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The creation of Maschinenausgleichstellen in Belgium and
Holland is pending. One of the main difficulties, in this field,
is to overcome the resistance of the owners of the factories,
as well as that of the local government offices of the occupied
territories.</p>
<hr class='tbk671'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The occupation authorities will have to use every means
to break this resistance.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In conclusion, Veltjens alludes in his report to the Roges company,
which was a special organization for the transport to Germany
of the booty captured in the occupied countries, and more particularly,
of products acquired by operations on the black market. One
of the directors of this organization, called Ranis, was interrogated on
1 November 1945, and declared in substance that the Roges company
had begun its activity in February 1941, succeeding another organization.
On the whole he confirms the facts that are reported in Veltjens’
report. I shall therefore simply submit a copy of his interrogation
to the Tribunal under Document Number RF-113.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scope of the operations on the black market is thus
established by German documents which cannot be contested by
the opposite side. I beg to point out to you that these documents
prove that within 5 months, in three countries, these operations
amount to the sum of 1,107,792,818 Reichsmark. We shall come back
to certain details when examining the special situation of certain
countries. However, it is necessary for me to indicate the reasons
why the Defendant Göring finally came to decide that the black
market operations should be suspended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, on 15 March 1943, under the pretext of avoiding the
risk of inflation in the occupied countries, Göring decided that black
market purchases be suspended. We have just seen that the Defendant
Göring worried little about the fate of the population of the
occupied countries, since he had decided that the black market
purchases were to continue even at the risk of inflation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The true reason is the following: While the official German
organizations were buying at prices which were strictly fixed by
them, the clandestine organizations were accepting much higher
prices. The merchandise was therefore always gravitating to the
black market, to the detriment of the official market; and clandestine
production in the end absorbed the normal production.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally it must be added that the corruption resulting from such
practices in certain circles of the German Armed Forces became
disquieting to the German leaders. The black market was therefore
suppressed officially on 15 March 1943, but some purchasing bureaus
<span class='pageno' title='532' id='Page_532'></span>
continued their clandestine activities until the time of liberation
but on a much smaller scale than before 15 March 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cite a passage of the report of the French Economic Control
which I have just put into evidence as Document Number RF-107
and which gives an idea of the disorder that was created by the
German actions and which shows the reasons why the Reich
authorities officially suspended the black market purchases—Page 21
of the French text:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“That was the time when champagne, cognac, and benedictine
were handled by lots of 10,000 to 50,000 bottles and <span class='it'>pâte de
foie gras</span> by the ton! From the very beginning the general
corruption had affected a great number of the Wehrmacht
officers, attracted by the sumptuous life which surrounded
them. It penetrated so far into the German military circles
that, from the lower mess sergeant up to the superior officer,
each one was implicated with the worst traffickers, demanding
commissions on all the deals. In a clandestine sale of wool
thread the authorities found themselves face to face with a
general of the Air Force.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Around them soon flocked all the bad elements of France,
swindlers and other habitual criminals. Then came a crowd of all
the customary trade traffickers, brokers, and out-of-work agents,
generally unimportant middlemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is understood that in such a circle, composed of unknown and
elusive people, the black market deals which were transacted
without invoices and in cash, and without written receipts, except
those of the German offices, cannot today be easily disclosed and
evaluated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I resume the quotation at Page 22:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Originating in the course of the year 1941, the commercial
agitation of these Parisian purchasing bureaus continued in
this manner for about 20 months. But, after having attained
its peak at the end of 1942, this activity came to an abrupt
end in March 1943, a victim of its own excesses.</p>
<hr class='tbk672'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Actually, during the entire occupation production prices
were strictly limited by the French authorities and even more
so by the German economic services which were systematically
opposed to any increase in prices and anxious, above all, to
maintain large purchasing power for the French money at
their disposal.</p>
<hr class='tbk673'/>
<p class='noindent'>“But, since the supplies delivered to the enemy under contract
were being paid for at prices hardly better than the legal
ones, the clandestine purchasing agencies accepted at the
same time rates several times higher for the same products.
<span class='pageno' title='533' id='Page_533'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk674'/>
<p class='noindent'>“So the conveying of merchandise to the German black market
increased more and more, while the secret production of goods
to be forwarded through these dark channels increased. The
disorder became rapidly such that, in certain branches of
industry, deliveries according to contract could not be carried
out except with great delay, in spite of the menacing protests
of the German authorities.</p>
<hr class='tbk675'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Completely aghast, the French Ministry of Industrial Production
had to inform the German authorities that the
national production would soon no longer be able to meet its
obligations.</p>
<hr class='tbk676'/>
<p class='noindent'>“This obvious situation, together with the necessity of putting
an end to the incredible corruption brought about by the black
market in the Wehrmacht, led the Reich Government, if not
totally to suppress the black market, at least to consider
closing the Paris purchasing bureaus.</p>
<hr class='tbk677'/>
<p class='noindent'>“This measure was made effective 13 March 1943 according
to an agreement between Bichelonne and General Michel.</p>
<hr class='tbk678'/>
<p class='noindent'>“However”—and this is very significant—“the German economic
services did not fail to ask in compensation for a considerable
rise in the quotas fixed under the agreements. Thus
for the Kehrl plan alone this rise amounted to 6,000 tons of
textiles.</p>
<hr class='tbk679'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Only a few bureaus were able to carry on their activities
until the liberation, either by endeavoring to execute their
purchases through Roges (D’Humières, Economic Union, <span class='it'>et
cetera</span>), or collaborating with military authorities buying
supplies and with the bureaus of the German Air force and
the Navy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: In the course of my explanations I shall come
back to the case of each particular country, concerning the black
market operations, in order to show their extent. But I think that,
just now, it is established by the Veltjens report, as well as by
the passages from the French Economic Control report which I had
the honor to read to the Tribunal, that the black market was
organized by the leaders of the Reich, and especially by the
Defendant Göring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And to finish the general observations concerning economic
plundering, I beg the Tribunal’s permission to give a few explanations
from the legal point of view. That is the subject of
Chapter 5 of this first part.
<span class='pageno' title='534' id='Page_534'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>From a legal point of view it is not contestable that organized
plundering of the countries invaded by Germany is prohibited by
the International Hague Convention, signed by Germany and
deliberately violated by her, even though her leaders never failed
to invoke this Convention every time they tried to benefit by it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Section III of the Hague Convention, entitled “The Military
Authority over the Territories of the Enemy State,” relates to
economic questions. These clauses are very clear and need not be
discussed. If the Tribunal will allow me to recall them in reading,
here is Section III of the Hague Convention which I put into the
document book as Document Number RF-114, and which is entitled,
“The Military Authority over the Territories of the Enemy State”:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 42: A territory is considered occupied when it is
placed actually under the authority of the hostile army. The
occupation extends only to the territories where this authority
has been established and can be exercised.</p>
<hr class='tbk680'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Article 43: The authority of the legitimate power having in
fact passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think we can take judicial notice of these
articles of the Convention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: I shall therefore not read this article, since
the Tribunal knows the Convention, and shall simply limit myself
to certain juridical remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These texts of the Hague Convention show in a very clear way
that the Germans could seize in occupied countries only what was
necessary for the maintenance of troops indispensable in the occupation
of the territories. All items which were levied beyond these
limits were in violation of the texts which you know, and consequently
these acts were acts of plundering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Counsel for the Defense may contend that all these prescriptions
must be put aside, because Germany had set herself the goal of
continuing the war against Britain, the U.S.S.R., and the United
States of America. The Defense may claim that, because of this,
Germany was in a state of need and had to counter the prescriptions
of the Hague Convention, trying to interpret the Article 23 G as
allowing destruction or seizure even of private property.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall immediately answer that this text does not lay down
rules relating to the conduct of the occupant in enemy territory.
These last prescriptions are contained, I repeat, in Articles 42 to 56,
but they referred to the conduct, which the belligerents must observe
in the course of the combat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words “to seize” in the sentence, “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to seize enemy property
except in cases where .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. these seizures are absolutely demanded
by military necessity,” mean—and there can be no discussion as to
<span class='pageno' title='535' id='Page_535'></span>
translation because actually the French text is binding—the words
“to seize” mean not to appropriate a thing, but to put it under the
protection of the law with a view to leaving it unused, in the state
in which it was found, and keeping it for its true owner or for
whoever can show right to it. Such a seizure permits the military
authority, as long as the action lasts, to prevent the owner from
using the property against its troops, but it does not authorize the
military authority in any case to appropriate it for itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Acts of economic plunder are all contrary to the principles of
international law and furthermore are formally provided for by
Article 6b of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal of
August 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These constant violations of the Hague Convention had the result
of enriching Germany and permitted her to continue the war against
Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States, while they ruined
the invaded countries, the populations of which, subjected to a
regime of slow famine, are now physically weakened and, but for
the victory of the Allies, would be on the road to progressive extermination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These inhuman deeds therefore constitute War Crimes which
come within the competency of the International Military Tribunal
as far as the leaders of the Reich are concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before finishing this rapid summary of juridical questions, the
Tribunal will permit me to refute in advance an argument which
will certainly be presented by the Defense, especially as far as
economic plunder is concerned. They will claim that your high
jurisdiction did not exist, that international penal law had not yet
been formulated in any text when the defendants perpetrated the
acts with which they are at present charged, and that therefore they
could not be condemned to any sentence whatsoever by virtue of
the principle of non-retroactivity of penal laws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why, Gentlemen, is this principle adopted by modern legislation?
It is indisputable that any person who is conscious of never having
violated any legal prescription could not be condemned because of
acts which were committed in such circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For example, somebody issues a check without funds to cover it,
before his country had adopted a penalty for such an offense. But
the case which is submitted to you is quite different. The defendants
cannot maintain that they were not conscious of having violated
legislation of any kind. First of all, they violated international
conventions: The Hague Convention of 1907, the Kellogg-Briand
Pact of 27 August 1938, and then they violated all the penal laws
of the invaded countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How, in these proceedings, shall economic plunder be qualified?
Theft, swindling, blackmail, and even, I will add, murder—since, in
<span class='pageno' title='536' id='Page_536'></span>
order to attain their aims, the Germans have premeditated and
committed numerous murders which enabled them to intimidate the
population in order to plunder them better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the point of view of domestic law, these deeds certainly
fall under the application of Articles 295 and the following ones
of the French penal code, and especially of Article 303, which
stipulates as guilty of murder all offenders, of whatever category,
who, to execute their crimes, resort to torture or perpetrate barbarous
acts. I will add that the defendants violated even the German
criminal code, in particular under Articles 249 and following.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Counsel for the Defense will certainly stress that some leaders
of the invaded countries were in agreement with the Reich
Government as to the economic collaboration, and that consequently
the Reich Government cannot be charged with acts which derive
from these agreements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such arguments must be refuted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1.) If, in all the invaded countries, patriots resisted with more
or less courage, it is true that some of them, out of inertia, fear,
or self interest, turned traitors to their country. They have been
or will be condemned. But the crimes committed by certain of them
cannot be exonerating or even extenuating circumstances in favor
of the defendants, especially since the latter had very often put
these traitors in to manage the occupied countries. The fact of
having brought individuals to turn traitor to their country only
aggravates, on the contrary, the heavy charges against the defendants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2.) These so-called agreements had all been obtained by
pressure or by threat. The concluded contracts show that they were
solely in favor of Germany, who, as a matter of fact, never brought
any compensation or illusory benefits—very often their burdensome
nature is seen from the mere reading of such contracts, as I will
have the honor to show in certain particular cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With these explanations my general observations on the economic
pillage are concluded, and if the Tribunal is willing we can examine
the particular case of Denmark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Germans invaded Denmark, contrary to all the
prescriptions of the law of nations and to their engagements, they
were not certain of rapidly dominating Western Europe. At first
they laid down the principle that they would not take anything
in the country, but after their success of May 1940 their attitude
changed; and little by little they treated Denmark more or less like
the other occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, they sought to achieve annexation pure and simple,
and took rigorous measures against the population only in the
course of 1942, when they saw that they would not be able to win
Denmark over. From the economic point of view, and to assure
<span class='pageno' title='537' id='Page_537'></span>
their domination, they tried to have at their disposal the majority
of the Danish means of payment, and they used to this effect two
methods which to a great extent were used by them in other
countries: (1) The levying of a veritable tribute of war, under the
pretext of maintaining their army of occupation; (2) the functioning
of the so-called clearing agreement to their almost exclusive benefit.
These two methods should be studied in Chapter I of this statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chapter I, German seizure of the means of payment; costs of
occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Article 49 of the Hague Convention stipulates that if the
occupant levies a tax the money will only be for the army of
occupation or for the administration of the territory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The occupant can therefore levy a tax for the maintenance of
its army, but this tax must not exceed the sum strictly necessary.
The needs of the army of occupation mean, not the costs of
armament and equipment, but only the costs of billeting, food, and
pay. I say normal expenses, which exclude luxuries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Article 52 authorizes the occupying power to exact from the
communes or inhabitants, for the needs of the army, requisitions
in kind and services, with the express condition that they should
be proportionate with the resources of the country and of such
a nature that they should not imply for the population the obligation
to take part in operations against their own country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same Article 52 stipulates that levies in kind shall be paid
as far as possible in cash; otherwise they are to be confirmed by
receipts and the sums due paid as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In other words, the Hague Convention allows the occupying
army to requisition in occupied territories what is necessary for
the maintenance of the troops but under two conditions, apart
from contributions in kind: 1) That the requisitions and the services
should be proportionate to the resources of the country, that is
to say, that sufficient should be left over for the inhabitants, to
enable them at least to live; 2) that the levies should be paid as
soon as possible. This is not a question of fictitious payment made
with funds extorted from occupied countries, but actual payment,
which implies supplying real equivalents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Article 53 of the Convention of The Hague which permits the
occupying powers to seize everything which could be turned
against them—and in particular, cash, funds, and securities of all
kinds belonging to the state of the occupied country—does not
authorize the occupying power to appropriate them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to information furnished by the Danish Government,
when the Germans entered Denmark they declared that they would
not demand anything from the country, but that supplies for the
German Army would come from the Reich.
<span class='pageno' title='538' id='Page_538'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, instead of buying Danish crowns to permit their
troops to spend money in Denmark, as early as 9 May 1940 they
imposed the circulation of notes of the Reichskreditkasse, which is
shown in Number 26 of the VOBIF, which I have already submitted
under Document Number RF-93.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the protestations of the National Danish Bank against the
issuing of foreign paper money, the Germans withdrew these notes
from circulation, but demanded the opening of an account at the
National Bank, promising to draw upon it only for sums which were
essential for the maintenance of their army in Denmark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Germans did not lose time in violating their promises
and in levying on their account, in spite of the Danish protests, sums
infinitely superior to the needs of the army of occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the information given by the Danish Government,
the Germans levied, per month, an average of 43 million crowns
in 1940; 37 million crowns in 1941; 39 million crowns in 1942;
83 million crowns in 1943; 157 million crowns in 1944; 187 million
crowns in 1945. The total of these levies amounts, according to the
Danish Government, to 4,830 million crowns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit, as Document Number RF-115, the financial report of
the Danish Government concerning this, a report to which I shall
refer again in the course of this statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The indications of the Danish Government are corroborated by
a German document discovered by the United States Army, Document
EC-86, Page 11, which I submit to the Tribunal as Exhibit
Number RF-116.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is a secret report of 10 October 1944, written by the
Arbeitsstab Ausland, and concerns the requisition of funds of the
occupied territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 11 the following is said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Denmark is not considered as occupied territory, and therefore
does not pay occupation expenses. The means necessary
for the German troops are placed at the disposal of the
central administration of the Reichskreditkasse by the Central
Danish Bank, through channels of ordinary credit. In any
case, for the duration of the war uniform payment by
Denmark is assured.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The writer of this report says that the levies to 31 March 1944,
for occupation expenses, amount to: 1940-1941, 531 million crowns;
1941-1942, 437 million crowns; 1942-1943, 612 million crowns;
1943-1944, 1,391 million crowns; which represents, up to 31 March
1944, levies amounting to 2,971 million crowns. This corresponds
to the information given by the Danish Government for approximately
the same period—2,723 million crowns.
<span class='pageno' title='539' id='Page_539'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The same German report shows that the rate of exchange for
the mark, as compared to the rate of exchange for the crown, had
been fixed by the occupying powers at 47.7, then at 53.1 marks
per 100 crowns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even though the Germans claim, against all evidence, that
Denmark was not an occupied territory, they levied in this country
the total sum of 4,830 million crowns, an enormous sum in view of
the number of inhabitants and the resources of the country. In
reality, this was nothing other than a war tribute which Germany
imposed under the pretext of furnishing means of payment to her
army stationed in Denmark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maintenance of the army necessary for occupying Denmark
did not necessitate such large expenses. It is evident that the Germans
used, as in other countries, the majority of the funds extorted
from Denmark to finance their war effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chapter II, clearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1931 Germany faced financial difficulties, which she used
as a pretext to declare a general moratorium on all her foreign
obligations. Nevertheless, to be able to continue, to a certain extent,
her commercial operations with foreign countries, she concluded
with most of the other nations agreements permitting the payment
of her commercial debts, and even of certain financial debts, on
the basis of a system of compensation called “clearing”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ever since the beginning of the occupation, 9 April 1940, and
for its duration, the Danish authorities did everything they could,
but in vain, to counteract German activity in this direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the pressure of occupying forces Denmark could not
prevent her credit in the clearing balance from constantly increasing,
owing to the German purchases which were made without the
guarantee of any equivalent. According to the Danish Government,
the credit balance of the account progressed in the following way:
31 December 1940, 388,800,000 crowns; 31 December 1941, 784,400,000
crowns; 31 December 1942, 1,062,200,000 crowns; 31 December 1943,
1,915,800,000 crowns; 31 December 1944, 2,694,600,000 crowns; 30 April
1945, 2,900 million crowns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These data are corroborated by those of the German report which
I submitted a few minutes ago under Exhibit Number RF-116
(Document Number EC-86), and according to which, on 31 March 1944,
the Germans had procured for themselves means of payment,
through clearing, amounting to a total sum of 2,243 million crowns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has not been possible to establish the use the occupants made
of the sum of 7,730 million crowns which they obtained fraudulently,
to the detriment of Denmark, with the help of the indemnity of
occupation and of clearing.
<span class='pageno' title='540' id='Page_540'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The information which we have up to now does not enable us
to estimate the extent of the operations carried out by the Germans
on the black market. Nevertheless, the writer of the report of
10 October 1944, presented previously, indicates; and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“An estimate of the amounts spent on the black market must
not be made. Of course, one may assume that members of the
Wehrmacht are buying at top prices butter and other products
in Denmark. But it is impossible to fix these sums even
approximately, for the black market seems to be less widespread
and less well co-ordinated than in the other occupied
territories of the West, and is closer to the structure of the
German black market with its fluctuating prices. Nevertheless,
the prices of the Danish black market can generally be considered
as much lower than the German prices. It is, therefore,
not possible to speak of an average high price, as for
instance in France, Belgium, and Holland.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is worth noting that the Germans, and especially members of
the Wehrmacht, used to operate on the black market and that
payment was effected with funds extorted from Denmark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the apparently regular requisitions, we also lack
the necessary information to be able to give precise details. Nevertheless,
according to a secret report of 15 October 1944, addressed
by the German officer of the Economic Staff for Denmark to his
superiors in Frankfurt an der Oder, a document discovered by the
United States Army and which I submit as Document Number RF-117,
the following goods were requistioned by his department:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“From January to July 1943, 30,000 tons of turf; in May 1944,
6,000 meters of wood.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The writer adds that they tried to push this production to 10,000
cubic meters per month.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in September 1944, 5,785 cubic meters of cut timber, 1,110
meters of uncut timber, 1,050 square meters of plywood,
119 tons of paint for ships, and special wood for the navy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Gentlemen, this is but an enumeration of the requisitions which
just one German section happened to make within a short time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denmark had to furnish large quantities of cement. Germany
furnished her, in exchange, with the coal necessary for this
manufacture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to this report which I have mentioned, in August 1944
the Germans bought in Denmark foodstuffs for over 8,312,278
crowns. These figures are less than the truth. According to the
last information we have received from the Danish Government,
the requisitions of agricultural items alone amounted, on an
<span class='pageno' title='541' id='Page_541'></span>
average, to 70 million crowns per month; which represents, for
60 months of occupation, requisitions to a value of 4,200 million
crowns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chapter III, requisitions not followed by payment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from that which they managed to buy with the help of
crowns which were deposited in their accounts under the pretext
of the maintenance of the army of occupation and of clearing, the
Germans appropriated an important quantity of things without
having paid for them in any seemingly regular manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in this way that they appropriated supplies from the
Danish Army and Navy—lorries, horses, means of transport,
furniture, clothing, the amount of which to date has not been
evaluated but might be estimated at about 850 million crowns.
Many requisitions and secret or even apparent purchases have not
yet been estimated exactly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same report, submitted under Document Number RF-115,
contains, on the part of the Danish Government, an approximate
and provisional estimate of the damages sustained by Denmark
and of the German plunder, which amounts to 11,600 million
crowns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The information which we have to date does not permit me
to give any more particulars concerning Denmark. I will, therefore,
if the Tribunal will permit me, begin with the particular case
of Norway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The economic plundering of Norway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German troops had only arrived in Norway when Hitler
declared, on 18 April 1940, that the economic exploitation of that
country should be proceeded with, and for that reason Norway
must be considered as an enemy state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The information which we have on the economic plundering of
Norway is rather brief; but it is, nevertheless, sufficient to estimate
the German activity in this country during the entire period of
the occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norway was subjected to a regime of most severe rationing. As
soon as they entered the country, the Germans tried—and this
was contrary to the most elementary principles of International
Law—to draw from Norway the maximum resources possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a document discovered by the United States Army, Document
Number ECH-34, which I submit as Exhibit Number RF-118, a
document which consists of the <span class='it'>Journal de Marche</span> of the economy
and armament service in Norway, written in April 1940, we have
excerpts of the directives relative to administration and economy
in the occupied territories.
<span class='pageno' title='542' id='Page_542'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Here are some excerpts from this document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Directive of Armament Economy:</p>
<hr class='tbk681'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Norwegian industry, to the extent to which it does not
directly supply the population, is, in its essential branches,
of particular importance for the German war industry. That
is why its production must be put, as soon as possible, at the
disposal of the German armament industry, if this has not
already been done. This production consists mainly of intermediate
products, which require a certain amount of time
to be turned into useful products, and of raw materials which—such
as aluminum, for example—can be used while we
wait for our own factories, which are being built, to be in a
position to produce.</p>
<hr class='tbk682'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In this connection, above all, the following industrial
branches must be taken into consideration:</p>
<hr class='tbk683'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Mining plants for the production of copper, zinc, nickel,
titanium, wolfram, molybdenum, silver, pyrites.</p>
<hr class='tbk684'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Furnaces for the production of alumina, aluminum, copper,
nickel, zinc.</p>
<hr class='tbk685'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Chemical industries for the production of explosives, synthetic
nitrogen, calcium nitrate, superphosphate, calcium
carbide, and sodium products.</p>
<hr class='tbk686'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Armament industries, naval dockyards, power stations,
especially those which are supplying electric current to the
above-named industries.</p>
<hr class='tbk687'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The production capacities of these industries must be maintained
at the highest possible level for the duration of the
occupation.</p>
<hr class='tbk688'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A certain measure of assistance by the Reich will, at times,
be necessary to overcome industrial bottlenecks which are
to be expected on account of the cutting off of English and
overseas imports.</p>
<hr class='tbk689'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Of particular importance is the guaranteeing of raw
material industries which to a considerable part depend on
overseas imports.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For the moment it may be left undecided whether a future
supply of bauxite from the German stocks is necessary for
utilizing the capacities of the aluminum plants.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the troops entered Norway, Germany issued notes of
the Reichskreditkasse which were legal tender only in Norway
and which could not be used in Germany. As in the other occupied
countries, this was a means of pressure to obtain financial
advantages, which were supposedly freely given by the brutally
enslaved countries.
<span class='pageno' title='543' id='Page_543'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans did their best to become masters of the means
of payment and of Norwegian credit by the two methods which
have become classic: Imposition of a veritable war tribute, on the
pretext of the maintenance of the army of occupation, and also the
working of a system of clearing to their profit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>German seizure of the means of payment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, indemnities for the maintenance of the army of occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the beginning of the occupation, the Germans used for their
purchases notes of the Reichskreditkasse. The Norwegian holders
of this paper money used to change it at the Bank of Norway,
but this financial institution could not obtain from the Reichskreditkasse
any real equivalent. In July 1940 the Bank of Norway had
to absorb 135 million Reichsmark from the Reichskreditkasse. To
avoid losing control over monetary circulation, the Bank of
Norway was obliged to put the Norwegian notes at the disposal of
the Germans, who drew checks on the Reichskreditkasse which the
Bank of Norway was obliged to discount.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The debit account of the Bank of Norway, following the German
levies, amounted to:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1,450 million crowns at the end of 1940; 3,000 million crowns
at the end of 1941; 6,300 million crowns at the end of 1942; 8,700
million crowns at the end of 1943; 11,676 million crowns at the
liberation of the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the Norwegian protests were in vain in the face of German
extortions. The constant threat of the new issuing of notes of the
Reichskreditkasse as instruments of obligatory payment beside the
Norwegian currency obliged the local financial authorities to accept
the system of levies on account, without actual cover, which was
less dangerous than the issuing of paper money over the circulation
of which the Norwegian administration had no power of control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This may be seen in particular from a secret letter sent on
17 June 1941 by General Von Falkenhorst, Commander-in-Chief in
Norway, to the Reich Commissioner, Reichsleiter Terbeven, a copy
of which was found not long ago in Norway and which I submit
to the Tribunal as Document Number RF-119. In this document,
after having stated that one could not reduce the expenses of the
Wehrmacht in Norway, Von Falkenhorst writes:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I am, however, of the opinion that the problem cannot be
solved at all in this manner. The only remedy is to abandon
completely the actual monetary system by introducing Reich
currency. But of course this does not come into my
domain. I regret, therefore, that I am not able to propose
any other remedies to you, although I am fully conscious of
the seriousness of the situation in which you find yourself.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='544' id='Page_544'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>To the indemnities for the alleged maintenance of the army of
occupation must be added a sum of 3,600 million crowns paid by
the Norwegian Treasury for the billeting of German troops. This
information comes to us from a report from the Norwegian Government,
which I submit as Document Number RF-120.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the sum of approximately 12,000 million crowns levied
for the alleged maintenance of the occupation troops, a large part
was used for other purposes; for the police and propaganda, in particular,
the occupation spent 900 million crowns. This comes from a
second report of the Norwegian Government, which I submit as
Document Number RF-121.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Secondly, clearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clearing agreement of 1937 for the barter of goods between
Norway and Germany remained in force during the occupation but
it was the Bank of Norway which had to advance the necessary
funds for the Norwegian exporters. The Germans also concluded
clearing agreements in the name of Norway with other occupied
countries, neutral countries, and with Italy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the liberation, the credit balance of Norwegian clearing
amounted to 90 million crowns but this balance does not show the
actual situation. In fact:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1) The imports destined to the German military needs in Norway
were handled through clearing in a very improper manner;</p>

<p class='pindent'>2) For certain goods especially (pelts, furs, and fish) the Germans
had demanded that exportation should be made to the Reich. Then
they sold these products again in other countries, especially Italy
as far as fish was concerned;</p>

<p class='pindent'>3) The Germans, who controlled the fixing of prices, systematically
raised the price of all products imported into Norway which,
moreover, were used for the greater part for the military needs of
the occupation. On the other hand, they systematically lowered
the prices of the products exported from Norway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of all their efforts and sacrifices, and owing to the
fraudulent operations of the occupiers, the Norwegian authorities
could not prevent a very dangerous inflation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the report of the Norwegian Government, which I submitted
under Document Number RF-120 a few moments ago, it is
seen that the paper currency which in April 1940 amounted to
712 million crowns, rose progressively to reach, on 7 May 1945,
3,039 million crowns. An inflation of this extent, resulting from
the activities of the occupiers, enables us to measure the impoverishment
of the country. The same report indicates that the Germans
did not manage to seize the gold of the Norwegian Bank, as that
had been hidden in good time.
<span class='pageno' title='545' id='Page_545'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us now, Gentlemen, examine the levies in kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans proceeded, in Norway, to make numerous
requisitions which were or were not followed by so-called regular
payments. According to the report of the Norwegian Government,
here is the list of requisitioned goods: Meat, 30,000 tons; dairy
products and eggs, 61,000 tons; fish, 26,000 tons; fruit and vegetables,
68,000 tons; potatoes, 500,000 tons; beverages and vinegar, 112,000
tons; fats, 10,000 tons; wheat and flour, 3,000 tons; other foodstuffs,
5,000 tons; hay and straw, 300,000 tons; other fodder, 13,000 tons;
soap, 8,000 tons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this list which I have just read to the Tribunal includes
only the official purchases, which were made with Norwegian
currency and paid for through clearing; it does not include the
illicit purchases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At present, it is not yet possible to make estimates. As an
example, we can say, however, that the export of fish, most of
which went to Germany, for 1 year only (1942) came to about
202,400 tons, whereas the official requisitions during the whole
occupation amounted only to 26,000 tons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As in other occupied territories, the Germans forced the
continuation of work under threat of arrest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of the Norwegian merchant fleet escaped from the
Germans; nevertheless, they requisitioned all the ships they could,
especially most of the fishing boats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even if the occupier could not seize all railway rolling stock,
trams, as well as about 30,000 motor vehicles, were transported to
Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If we refer to the report of 10 October 1944 of the German
Economic Service, which I submitted under Exhibit RF-116
(Document Number EC-86), we will see that the writer of the
report himself estimates that the effort demanded from Norway
was beyond her possibilities; and he writes:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Norwegian economy is especially heavily burdened by
the demands of the occupation Forces. For this reason the
cost of occupation had to be limited to cover only a part of
the expenses of the Wehrmacht.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After having mentioned that the cost of occupation which had
been collected up to January 1943 amounted to 7,535 million crowns,
which corroborates the data given by the Norwegian Government,
the writer of the German report says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This sum of more than 5,000 million Reichsmark is, indeed,
very high for Norway. Much richer countries, as for example,
Belgium, pay hardly more, and Denmark does not even
supply half of this sum. These large payments can only be
<span class='pageno' title='546' id='Page_546'></span>
made possible by German additions. It is, therefore, not
surprising that the German-Norwegian trade is in Germany’s
favor—that is, it is subsidized. Norway, owing to her very
small population, can hardly put labor at the disposal of the
German war economy. She is, therefore, one of the few
countries which owe us certain amounts in clearing.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Further on, the writer adds:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If we deduct approximately 140 million Reichsmark from
the expenses of the occupation and the various credits
calculated above, we have Norwegian payments to the
still considerable amount of approximately 4,900 million
Reichsmark.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps that would be a good time to
break off.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='547' id='Page_547'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: I had the honor, this morning, of relating
to you how the occupiers were able to exact great quantities of the
means of payment from Norway. We shall now see, from the first
data which have been given us, the use to which the occupiers put
these means of payment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans seized, as in the other occupied countries, considerable
private property on some pretext or other—property
belonging to Jews, Freemasons, or Scout associations. It has been
impossible, so far, to make a very exact evaluation of this spoliation.
We can therefore only give some indication from memory. According
to the report of the Norwegian Government, submitted under
Document Number RF-121, in 1941 the Germans seized all the radio
sets.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you any evidence to support the facts
you are stating now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: This is based on information contained in
the report of the Norwegian Government which I have submitted
under Document Number RF-121.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: According to that report, in 1941 the Germans
seized almost all the radio sets belonging to private individuals.
The value of these radio sets is approximately 120 million
kroner. The Germans imposed heavy fines on the Norwegian
communities under the most varied pretexts, notably Allied bombing
raids and acts of sabotage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the report presented under Document Number RF-121 the
Norwegian Government gives two or three examples of these
collective fines: on 4 March 1941, after a raid on Lofoten, the
population of the small community of Ostvagoy had to pay 100,000
kroner. Communities also had to support German families and
families of “Quislings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 25 September 1942, after a British raid on Oslo, one hundred
citizens were obliged to pay 3,500,000 kroner. In January 1941
Trondheim, Stavanger, and Vest-Opland had to pay 60,000, 50,000,
and 100,000 kroner, respectively. In September 1941 the municipality
of Stavanger was obliged to pay 2 million kroner for an alleged
sabotage of telegraph lines. In August 1941 Rogaland had to pay
500,000 kroner, and Aalesund had to pay 100,000 kroner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It can thus be stated in principle that, by various procedures
which differed hardly from those employed in other countries, the
Germans during the occupation of Norway not only exhausted all
<span class='pageno' title='548' id='Page_548'></span>
the financial resources of that country but placed it considerably in
debt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has not been possible to furnish a detailed account of German
extortions, whether made after requisitions, followed or not by
indemnities, or by purchase, apparently conducted by mutual
agreement fictitiously settled with those very means of payment
extorted from Norway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the report which I have submitted under Document Number
RF-121, the Norwegian Government tabulated the damages and
losses suffered by its country. I shall give a summary of this table
to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Norwegian Government estimates that the damages suffered
by industry and commerce amount to a total of 440 million kroner,
of which the Germans have paid, fictitiously of course, only 7 million
kroner; merchant vessels to the value of 1,733 million kroner,
for which Germany has made no settlement; damage to ports and
installations amounts to 74 million kroner, for which Germany has
settled fictitiously only to the extent of 1 million kroner; for
railroads, canals, airports, and their installations, the spoliation
represents the sum of 947 million, for which Germany has fictitiously
paid 490 million kroner; roads and bridges, 199 million kroner, for
which the settlement amounts to 67 million; spoliation of agriculture
reached 242 million kroner, of which only 46 million have been
settled; personal property, 239 million, of which nothing has been
settled; various requisitions, not included in the preceding categories,
amount to 1,566 million kroner, for which the occupier, fictitiously,
has settled up to the amount of 1,154 million kroner. The Norwegian
Government estimates that the years of man-labor applied to the
German war effort represent a sum of 226 million kroner. It estimates,
on the other hand, that the years of man-labor lost to the
national economy by deportation to Germany and forced labor by
the order of Germany amounts to 3,122 million kroner. Forced
payments to German institutions amount to 11,054 million kroner,
for which Germany has made no settlement whatsoever. The grand
total, according to the Norwegian Government, is 21,086 million
kroner, which represents 4,700 million dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norway suffered particularly during the German occupation.
Indeed, though her resources are considerable, notably timber from
the forests, minerals such as nickel, wolfram, molybdenum, zinc,
copper, and aluminum, nevertheless Norway must import indispensable
food products for feeding her population.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the Germans had absolute control over maritime traffic,
nothing could come into Norway without their consent. They could
therefore, by pressure, as they had to do in France by means of
the line of demarcation between the two zones, impose their
<span class='pageno' title='549' id='Page_549'></span>
demands more easily. The rations, as fixed by the occupiers, were
insufficient to insure the subsistence of the Norwegian population.
The continued undernourishment over a period of years resulted
in very serious consequences: Disease multiplied, mortality likewise
increased, and the future of the population has been jeopardized
by the physical deficiencies of its younger element.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These are the few observations which I had to make on the
subject of Norway. I shall, if the Tribunal will permit, now deal
with the part which relates to the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Economic pillage of the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In invading the Netherlands in contravention of all the principles
of the law of nations, the Germans installed themselves in a country
abundantly provided with the most varied wealth, in a country
in which the inhabitants were the best nourished of Europe and
which, in proportion to the population, was one of the wealthiest in
the world. The gold reserve of Holland exceeded the amount of
bills in circulation. Four years later when the Allies liberated that
country, they found the population afflicted by a veritable famine;
and apart from the destruction resulting from military operations,
a country almost entirely ruined by the spoliation of the occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dishonest intentions of Germany appear in a secret report
by Seyss-Inquart on his governorship. This report, dating from
29 May to 19 July 1940, was discovered by the United States Army.
It has been registered under the number Document 997-PS, and I
submit it to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number RF-122. These are
the chief extracts from this report:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It was clear that with the occupation of the Netherlands
a large number of economic and also police measures had to
be taken, the first ones of which were for the purpose of
reducing the consumption of the population in order to obtain
supplies for the Reich, on the one hand, and to secure a just
distribution of the remaining supplies, on the other hand.
With regard to the task assigned, endeavors had to be made
for all these measures to bear the signature of Dutchmen.
The Reich Commissioner therefore authorized the Secretaries
General to take all the necessary measures through legal
channels.</p>
<hr class='tbk690'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In fact, to date, nearly all orders concerning the seizure
of supplies and their distribution to the population and all
decrees regarding restrictions on the moulding of public
opinion have been issued. But agreements concerning the
transport of extraordinarily large supplies to the Reich have
also been made, all of which bear the signatures of the Dutch
Secretaries General or the competent economic leaders, so that
all of these measures have the character of being voluntary.
<span class='pageno' title='550' id='Page_550'></span>
It should be mentioned in this connection that the Secretaries
General were told in the first conference that loyal co-operation
was expected of them, but that they were entitled
to resign if something should be ordered which they felt
they could not endorse. Up to date none of the Secretaries
General have made use of this privilege, so that one may
reasonably conclude that they have complied with all requests
of their own free will.</p>
<hr class='tbk691'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The seizure and distribution of food supplies and textiles
have been almost completed. At least all the appropriate
orders have been issued and are being executed.</p>
<hr class='tbk692'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A series of instructions concerning the reorientation of
agriculture have been issued and are being executed. The
essential point is to use the available fodder in such a way
that as large a stock as possible of horned cattle, about
80 percent, will be carried over into the next farming season,
at the expense of the disproportionately high stock of chickens
and hogs. Rules and restrictions have been introduced in the
organization of traffic, and the rationing of gasoline was
applied on the same lines as in the Reich.</p>
<hr class='tbk693'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Restriction of the right to give notice at work, as well as
to cancel leases, has been issued in order to curb the liberal
and capitalistic habits of the Dutch employers and to avoid
unrest. In the same way the terms for repayment of debts
have been extended under certain circumstances.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk694'/>
<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the ordinance concerning registration and control of
enemy property, as well as confiscation of the property of
persons who show hostility to the Reich and to Germans,
were issued in the name of the Reich Commissioner. On the
basis of this ordinance an administrator has already been
appointed for the property of the royal family.</p>
<hr class='tbk695'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Stocks of raw materials have been seized and, with the
consent of the General Field Marshal, distributed in such a
way that the Dutch have enough raw materials to maintain
their economy for half a year, so that they receive the same
allocation quotas as obtain in the Reich. The same principle
of equal treatment is being used in the supply of food, et
cetera. This enabled us to secure considerable supplies of
raw materials for the Reich, as for instance 70,000 tons of
industrial fats, which is about half the amount which the
Reich is lacking. Legislation concerning exchange has been
introduced on the same pattern as in the Reich.</p>
<hr class='tbk696'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Finally we succeeded in causing the Dutch Government to
supply all the amounts which the Reich and the German
<span class='pageno' title='551' id='Page_551'></span>
administration in the Netherlands need, so that these expenses
do not burden the Reich budget in any way.</p>
<hr class='tbk697'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Sums of guilders have been made available to redeem the
occupation marks to the amount of about 36 million; an
additional 100 million for the purposes of the occupation
army, especially for extension of the airports; 50 million
for the purchase of raw materials to be shipped to the Reich,
so far as they are not booty; and amounts to guarantee the
unrestricted transfer of the savings of the Dutch workers
brought into the Reich, to their families, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>. Finally,
the rate of exchange of the occupation marks, set at first by
the Army High Command in the proportion of 1 guilder to
1.50 Reichsmark, has been reduced to the correct proportion
of 1 guilder to 1.33 Reichsmark.</p>
<hr class='tbk698'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Above all, however, it was possible to obtain the consent
of the President of the Bank of The Netherlands, Trip, to a
measure suggested by Commissioner General Fischböck and
approved by the General Field Marshal, namely the unrestricted
mutual obligation of accepting each other’s currency.
That means that the Bank of The Netherlands is bound
to accept any amount of Reichsmark offered to it by the Reich
Bank and in return to supply Dutch guilders at the rate
of 1.33, that is, 1 Reichsmark equals 75 cents. The Reich
Bank alone has control in these matters, not the Bank of The
Netherlands, which will be notified only of individual transactions.</p>
<hr class='tbk699'/>
<p class='noindent'>“This ruling goes far beyond all pertinent rulings hitherto
made with the political economies of neighboring countries,
including the Protectorate, and actually represents the first
step towards a currency union. In consideration of the
significance of the agreement, which already affects the
independence of the Dutch State, it is of special weight that
the President of the Bank, Trip, who is very well-known in
western banking and financial circles, signed this agreement
of his own free will in the above sense.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As you will see from the explanations which I shall have the
honor of submitting to you, it was chiefly in the Netherlands that
the Germans used all their ingenuity in extorting the means of
payment. This spoliation will form the subject of the first chapter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall then examine the use made by the occupiers of these
means of payment. In a second chapter we shall discuss the black
market; in a third, we shall consider the acquisition made in a
manner only outwardly regular; a fourth chapter will be devoted
to various kinds of spoliation. Finally, we shall touch upon the
chief consequences to the Netherlands of this economic pillage.
<span class='pageno' title='552' id='Page_552'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Chapter 1, German seizure of means of payment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A.) Indemnity for occupation costs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have already had the privilege, Gentlemen, of explaining under
what conditions and within what limit, by virtue of the Hague
Convention, the occupying power may raise contributions in money
for the maintenance of its army of occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall confine myself to reminding the Tribunal that these costs
which are charged to the occupied countries can include only the
costs of billeting, feeding, and possibly of paying those soldiers
strictly necessary for the occupation of territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans knowingly ignored these principles by imposing
upon the Netherlands the payment of an indemnity for the maintenance
of their troops which was far out of proportion to the needs
of the latter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to information furnished by the Netherlands Government,
which is contained in three reports (the reports of Trip,
Hirschfeld, and the Minister of Finance) which I submit as Document
Number RF-123, the following sums were exacted on the pretext
of being indemnity for the maintenance of occupation troops:
1940 (7 months), 477 million guilders; 1941, 1,124 million guilders;
1942, 1,181 million guilders; 1943, 1,328 million guilders; 1944,
1,757 million guilders; 1945 (4 months only), 489 million guilders.
That makes a total of 6,356 million guilders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sum as considerable as this constitutes a veritable war tribute
raised on the pretext of the maintenance of an army of occupation.
Germany thus fraudulently circumvented the regulations of the
Hague Convention to seize a considerable amount of means of
payment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>B.) Clearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1931 Germany, faced with economic and financial difficulties,
declared a general moratorium on her previous commitments.
Nevertheless, in order to be able to continue her foreign commercial
operations, she had concluded with most of the other countries,
notably with the Netherlands, agreements making possible the
settling of commercial debts and, to a certain extent, of financial
debts, on the basis of the exchange system called “clearing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the war there existed on the Netherlands “clearing” an
excess of imports from Germany. But after the first months of
occupation there was, on the contrary, a considerable excess of
exports to Germany, whereas the receipts coming from that country
dropped perceptibly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the month of June 1940 onward the Germans exacted from
the Dutch declarations of foreign currency, gold, precious metals,
securities, and foreign credits, as can be seen from the Ordinance
<span class='pageno' title='553' id='Page_553'></span>
of 24 June 1940, submitted as Document Number RF-95. Moreover,
the Dutch could, by virtue of the same ordinance, be obliged to
sell their stocks to the Bank of The Netherlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German Reich Commissioner, Seyss-Inquart, forced the
Bank of The Netherlands to make advances in guilders to maintain
equilibrium in clearing, since Germany could furnish no equivalent
in merchandise. On the other hand, it was decided that the clearing
system should be utilized for the delivery of merchandise as well
as for the payment of any debts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fact the Germans could buy merchandise and transferable
securities in Holland without furnishing any equivalent. The credits
in marks of the Dutch sellers were blocked in the Bank of The
Netherlands which, on its part, had been obliged to make an
equivalent advance on the clearing exchange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To attempt to limit the fall of the Dutch account on the clearing
exchange, and to avoid the transfer by this means of guilders or
of transferable stock into Germany, on 8 October 1940, the Secretary
General of Netherlands Finance imposed a large tax on the marks
that were blocked on the clearing exchange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, under date of 31 March 1941, the credit of the Netherlands
exceeded 400 million guilders, which in fact had been advanced
by the Netherlands Government. At this point the occupiers
demanded:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1) That a sum of 300 million guilders be withdrawn from the
balance of 400 million and deposited in the German Treasury under
the heading of “Military Occupation Costs Incurred ‘Outside’ The
Netherlands,” and this was independent of payments already made
by that country for the occupation costs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2) By a decision of the Reich Commissioner, under date of
31 March 1941, reported in the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> in France, Number
14, which I submit to the Tribunal as Document Number RF-124,
payment operations with the Reich were no longer to pass through
the clearing exchange but to be operated directly from bank to
bank, which would create direct credits of the Netherlands banks
on the German banks at the imposed exchange of 100 Reichsmark
for 75.36 guilders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3) By a decree of the same date, 31 March 1941, which I submit
as Document Number RF-125, the tax on blocked marks, created
on 8 October 1940 by the Netherlands authorities, was abolished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Faced with this situation, particularly dangerous to the Netherlands
treasury, Mr. Trip resigned his position as Secretary General
for Finance and President of The Netherlands Bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Reich Commissioner replaced him with Rost von Tonningen,
a notorious collaborator who complied with all the demands of the
occupying power.
<span class='pageno' title='554' id='Page_554'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>As the private banks were unwilling to keep credits in marks
at a rate very disadvantageous to the real parity of 100 Reichsmark
to 75.36 guilders, they transferred their credits in marks to the
Bank of The Netherlands. The credit account of the Institute of
Exports to Germany, through operations with that country, rose
considerably; while the credit balance as of 1 April 1941 amounted
to 235 million guilders, it was to rise by 1 May 1945, to 4,488 million
guilders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to information given by the Netherlands Government,
this credit was accounted for by purchases of all kinds of merchandise
made by the Germans in Holland, of transferable stock or other
valuable papers, by payment of services imposed upon Dutch
enterprises, the wages of workers deported to Germany, and the
liquidation debts incurred by the occupiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from these two methods—indemnities for the occupation
troops and clearing—the Germans procured resources for themselves
in another way—by imposing collective fines, and this in
violation of the provisions of Article 50 of the Hague Convention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of the occupation, under every pretext, the Germans
imposed, by way of reprisal or intimidation, considerable fines upon
the municipalities. These fines had to be paid by the inhabitants,
with the exception of persons of German nationality, members of
pro-Nazi associations (NSB, Waffen-SS, NSKK, Society for Technical
Aid Services of the Dutch-German cultural community), and persons
working for the Germans. According to information which has been
obtained up to the present, of only 62 municipalities the total fines
thus imposed amounted to a minimum of 20,243,024 guilders. This
is based on testimony of the Netherlands Government, which I
submit as Document Number RF-126.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the same testimony, in the archives forgotten by the
Germans at The Hague, there have been discovered two copies of
letters relative to these collective fines. According to the first of
these copies, which is a letter of 8 March 1941, collective fines
amounting to 18 million guilders had been raised at the beginning
of the year 1941. From the second, we learn that Hitler had given
the order to employ this sum for National Socialist propaganda in
the Netherlands. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Reich Commissioner, The Hague, 1808, 8 March 1941.</p>
<hr class='tbk700'/>
<p class='noindent'>“To Liaison Headquarters, Berlin, 1720 hours; to be submitted
immediately to Reichsleiter M. Bormann.</p>
<hr class='tbk701'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A sum of 18.5 million guilders representing contributions
exacted as reprisals from some Dutch cities, will arrive in
the next few days. The Reich Commissioner is inquiring
whether the Führer has earmarked this sum for a special
purpose or if it is to be used in the same way as the Führer
<span class='pageno' title='555' id='Page_555'></span>
has previously ordered in the case of confiscated enemy property.
At that time the Führer stipulated that these sums
should be spent in the Netherlands for the needs of the
community under the proper political considerations.</p>
<hr class='tbk702'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Heil Hitler!”—Signed—“Schmidt, Münster, Commissioner
General.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This, then, is the translation of the answer, Document Number
RF-126:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Obersalzberg, 19 March 1941, 1000; Number 4.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: One moment! Some of the copies which you
have just submitted to us don’t seem to be accurate and the passage
which you have just been reading is omitted from some of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Another copy of the document was presented to the President.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now have another copy of the document from which you have
read. The two copies which have been handed up are not identical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: The document has possibly been improperly
numbered. There are two documents, Number RF-126, which should
have been indicated as RF-126(1), and RF-126(2). The representative
of the Government of The Netherlands certifies the accuracy of the
translation of the first copy; and in the second RF-126 document
the same representative of the Netherlands Government certifies
the existence of the copy of the answer from the headquarters of
the Führer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The first document is the one you have just
read out. The second document begins with the words, “J’ai soumis
aujourd’hui.” Is that the second document to which you are
referring?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: It is the second document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Could we see the originals? They are two
different documents, are they? But they both begin in exactly the
same way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: The two documents have been submitted
by the Netherlands Government. The representative of the Government
of The Netherlands who has delivered them certifies that
these two documents were found in the Netherlands among German
papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: The Dutch Government was obliged to make
important payments into the German account; and in the reports
submitted as Document Number RF-123, it is clearly stated that:
<span class='pageno' title='556' id='Page_556'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>1) The Germans required that a sum of 300 million guilders,
which was written to the credit of the Bank of The Netherlands,
be used for the needs of their army of occupation outside the Netherlands
and that a sum of 76 million guilders in gold be deposited for
the same use. The total which the Netherlands had to pay under this
pretext, namely, the maintenance of armies of occupation in other
countries, was 376 million guilders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2) From June 1941 on, the Netherlands was obliged to pay, as
a contribution to the expenses of the war against Russia, a monthly
sum of 37 million guilders, of which a part was payable in gold.
The total of the sum that Germany raised under this heading is
1,696 million guilders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3) The Bank of The Netherlands was obliged to undertake the
redemption of Reichskreditkasse notes to the sum of 133 million
guilders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4) The costs of the civilian German government in Holland were
charged to that country and amounted to 173 million guilders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>5) The Dutch Treasury was, moreover, obliged to pay 414 million
guilders to the Reich account, covering divers expenses, such as
wages of Dutch workers deported to Germany, the costs of
evacuation of certain regions, costs of the demolition of fortifications,
so-called costs for guarding railroads, funds placed at the disposal
of the Reich Commissioner, and for various industries utilized
by the Germans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>6) The Germans in July 1940 seized 816 bars of gold bullion
belonging to the Bank of The Netherlands, which were in the
wreck of a Dutch ship sunk at Rotterdam, which represented,
including costs of recovery, 21 million guilders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>7) The Government of The Netherlands was obliged to bear
annual expenses of 1,713 million guilders to assure the financing
of new administrative services imposed on Holland by the
occupying power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this way, Holland lost 8,565 million guilders. Altogether,
including the raising of the gold from a ship sunk in the Meuse,
the payments actually made to Germany amount to 11,380 million
guilders. If these costs are added to the costs of occupation and
clearing, the total of the financial charges imposed on Holland
during the occupation amounts to the sum of 22,224 million
guilders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These operations had serious consequences for the economy
of the Netherlands. Indeed, the gold supply, which on 1 April 1940
amounted to 1,236 million guilders, had, by 1 April 1945, fallen
to 932 million guilders, owing to German levies.
<span class='pageno' title='557' id='Page_557'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The paper money in circulation, on the contrary, had risen
from 1,127 million guilders on 1 April 1940, to 5,468 million guilders
on 1 April 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Germans occupied the Netherlands, a great portion
of the gold of the Bank of The Netherlands had been sent abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the Germans, under various pretexts, seized all the
gold that was found in the vaults of the bank. I recall that, under
the heading of indemnity for occupation, they collected 75 million
gold guilders; and for the forced contribution of the Netherlands
in the war against Russia, they demanded about 14.4 million gold
guilders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rost von Tonningen, Secretary General of Finance and President
of the Bank of The Netherlands, appointed by the Germans, wrote
on 18 December 1943 to the Reich Commissioner that there had
not been any gold in Holland since the preceding March. The
copy of this letter is submitted as Document Number RF-127.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A document discovered by the United States Army, listed under
Number ECR-174, which I submit as Exhibit Number RF-128,
consists of a report of the Commissioner of the Bank of The Netherlands
of 12 June 1941. It, too, states that the gold reserve of the
Bank of The Netherlands amounted, on 12 June 1941, to 1,021.8
million guilders, of which only 134.6 million guilders were in
Holland, the rest being either in England, South Africa, or the
United States. The same report specifies that all the gold in
Holland had been removed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not only did the Germans seize the gold of the Bank of The
Netherlands, but they also made requisitions of the gold and other
means of foreign payment in the possession of the population. The
occupying power obliged private individuals to deposit gold which
was in their possession with the Bank of The Netherlands, after
which this gold was requisitioned and handed over to the Reichsbank.
A sum of approximately 71.3 million guilders was paid in
this way to the public in exchange for the requisitioned gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the same way also the Germans bought from the public
various foreign stocks to a sum of 13,224,000 guilders, and Swedish
Government securities to a sum of 4,623,000 guilders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With important financial means which they had at their disposal,
the Germans proceeded to make large purchases in Holland. Such
purchases, made with funds extorted from the Netherlands, cannot
be considered as having been made in exchange for a real
equivalent, but realized only by fictitious payments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans, in addition to numerous cases of requisitions
which were followed by no kind of settlement, proceeded to illicit
purchases on the black market and purchases outwardly regular.
<span class='pageno' title='558' id='Page_558'></span>
They thus procured a quantity of things of all kinds, leaving to
the population only a minimum of products insufficient to insure
their vital needs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the second chapter of this presentation we shall examine the
illicit purchases on the black market; and in a third chapter, the
purchases that were carried out in seemingly regular ways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chapter 2, the black market.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As in all other occupied countries, in Holland the Germans seized
considerable quantities of merchandise on the black market, in
violation of the legislation on rationing which they themselves had
imposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has not been possible, in view of the clandestine nature of
the operations, to determine even approximately the quantities of
all kinds of objects which the Germans seized by this dishonest
means. However, the secret report of the German Colonel Veltjens,
which I had the honor of submitting this morning under Exhibit
Number RF-112 (Document Number PS-1765) gives us for a period
of 5 months, from July to the end of November, some indications of
the scope of the German purchases. I quote a passage from the
Veltjens report:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the Netherlands, since the beginning of the action, the
following purchases were made and paid for by ordinary
bank remittances: Non-ferrous metals, 6,706,744 Reichsmark;
textiles, 55,285,568 Reichsmark; wool, 753,878 Reichsmark;
leather, skins, and hides, 4,723,130 Reichsmark; casks, 254,982
Reichsmark; furniture, 272,990 Reichsmark; food and comestibles,
590,859 Reichsmark; chemical and cosmetic products,
152,191 Reichsmark; various iron and steel wares, 3,792,166
Reichsmark; rags, 543,416 Reichsmark; motor oil, 52,284
Reichsmark; uncut diamonds, 25,064 Reichsmark; sundries,
531,890 Reichsmark. Total: 73,685,162 Reichsmark.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These purchases were paid for by checks on the banks. A large
quantity of other merchandise, the amount of which it has not been
possible to determine, was paid for by cash with guilders coming
from the so-called occupation indemnity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: In Chapter 3, which deals with the economic
plundering of the Netherlands, we will treat the question of
purchases of apparent regularity from information provided for us
by the Government of The Netherlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Industrial production.
<span class='pageno' title='559' id='Page_559'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>From testimony given by the representative of the Dutch
Government, which I submit as Document Number RF-129, it is
clear that the Germans utilized to their own profit the greater part
of the industrial potential of the Netherlands; all important stocks
which were in the factories were thus absorbed. The value of these
stocks was not less than 800 million guilders. Moreover, the
occupants proceeded to the removal of a large amount of machinery.
In certain cases these requisitions were not even followed by
fictitious settlements. It has not yet been possible to establish a
balance sheet of these spoliations, which often included all the
machinery of an industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As an example, we may indicate that on a requisition order of
4 March 1943, coming from the Reich Commissioner, all the
machinery and technical equipment, including the drawings and
blueprints of all the workshops and accessories of the blast
furnaces of an important factory, were removed without any
indemnity and transported to the vicinity of Brunswick for the
Hermann Göring Works. This is shown in the document I submit
as Document Number RF-130.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans had set up in all the occupied countries a certain
number of organizations charged specially with the pillaging of
machines. They had given them the name of Machine Pool Office.
These organizations, which were under the armament inspection,
received demands from German industry for means of production
and had to fulfill these demands by requisitions on the occupied
countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, groups of technicians were charged with locating,
dismantling, and transporting the machinery to Germany. The
organization of these official groups of pillagers can be learned
from German documents which are to be brought to your attention
when the special case of Belgium will be outlined to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We learn from the report of 1 March 1944, addressed to the
military commandant, that the Machine Pool Office of The Hague
could satisfy only a small proportion of the demands. Thus, under
date of 1 January 1944, these demands totalled 677 million Reichsmark,
whereas in the month of January only 61 million marks
worth of machinery had been delivered as against the new demands
of 87 million which made a total demand for machinery of
703 million Reichsmark at the end of January 1944. This is shown
in a document submitted as Document Number RF-131.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before leaving the Netherlands the Germans effected large-scale
destruction with a strategic aim, so they said, but above all with
the desire to do damage. When they demolished factories, they
removed beforehand and transported to Germany the machinery
<span class='pageno' title='560' id='Page_560'></span>
which they could dismantle, as well as the raw materials. They
acted in this manner particularly with respect to the Phillips
factories in Eindhoven, Hilversum, and Bussum; the oil dumps of
Amsterdam and Pernes; the armament factories of Breda, Tilburg,
Berg-op-Zoom, and Dordrecht. These facts are dealt with in the
report of the economic officer attached to the German military
commander in Holland, under date of 9 October 1944, which I
submit as Document Number RF-132.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same report gives some information on the organization of
German looters specialized in the removal of machinery. I give
here some extracts:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Phillips Works at Eindhoven was the first and the most
important military objective to be dealt with.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>A little farther on the writer continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Before the invasion by the enemy we succeeded in destroying
these important continental works for the manufacture
of radio valves, lamps, and radio apparatus. This was done
after Volunteer Commando 7”—Fwi.Kdo. 7—“had previously
removed the most valuable metals and special machines.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Farther on he writes:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Already on 7 September a commando unit transported in
trucks to the Reich most important non-ferrous metals
(wolfram, manganese, copper) and very valuable apparatus
from the Phillips Works. Volunteer Commando 7 continued
to participate in the transfer of finished and semi-finished
products as well as machines from the Phillips Works. Due
to the enemy’s occupation of Eindhoven, the removal came
to a stop. Then the clearing out of the branch factories of
Phillips at Hilversum and Bussum took place. Here it was
possible to remove completely all stocks of non-ferrous metal
products, finished and semi-finished goods, machinery, and
blueprints and designs necessary for production.</p>
<hr class='tbk704'/>
<p class='noindent'>“At the same time removal commandos were detailed to the
heads of the various provincial branch offices under the
representative of the Reich Ministry of Armaments and War
Production in the Netherlands.</p>
<hr class='tbk705'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In agreement with the forementioned services and the
competent civil offices, these commandos carried through the
removal of important raw materials and products, as well
as machinery. Through the unswerving and commendable
zeal of officers, officials, Sonderführer, and enlisted men it
was possible, during the month of September, to remove to
the Reich considerable stocks of raw materials and products
<span class='pageno' title='561' id='Page_561'></span>
and to supply the troops with useful material. This action
was initiated and directed in the western and southern
districts of the Netherlands by the officer in charge of
volunteers in the Netherlands.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then the writer ends, by saying:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“For the task of evacuation and for the preparation of the
ARLZ measures within the area of 15th Army Command,
a squad under the command of Captain Rieder was detached
by Volunteer Commando 7 which also had to act as liaison
with the quartermaster staff of the 15th Army Command.
In this case, too, in close co-operation with the civil officers
and Department IVa of 15th Army Command, good work
was done by the removal of raw materials and scarce goods
as well as machinery. These actions commenced only at the
end of the month covered by this report.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Requisition of raw materials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Together with the removal of machinery the Government of
The Netherlands gives us exact figures on the stocks of raw
materials and manufactured articles. Apart from the stocks located
in the factories, the Germans acquired considerable quantities of
raw materials and manufactured articles amounting to not less
than 1,000 million guilders. This evaluation does not include the
destruction resulting from military operations, which ranges around
300 million guilders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agriculture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans proceeded to make requisitions and wholesale
purchases of agricultural produce and livestock. A final estimate
of these requisitions, amounting to a minimum of 300 million
guilders, is as yet impossible. To give an idea of their magnitude
we point out that at the end of the year of 1943 the Germans had
seized 600,000 hogs, 275,000 cows, and 30,000 tons of preserved
meats, as is given in the testimony of the representative of
the Netherlands Government, which I submit as Document
Number RF-133.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In passing, we point out—although this question will be taken
up again by my colleague in his presentation of war crimes against
persons—that on 17 April 1944, without any apparent strategic
reason, 20 hectares of cultivated lands were flooded at Wieringermeer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Transport and communications.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans made enormous requisitions of transport and
communication material. It is not yet possible to draw up an exact
inventory of them. Nevertheless, the information given by the
Netherlands Government makes it possible to form an idea of the
magnitude of these spoliations.
<span class='pageno' title='562' id='Page_562'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit as Document Number RF-134 information given by the
representative of the Netherlands Government concerning transport
and communication. This is a summary of it:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(a) Railways—of 890 locomotives, 490 were requisitioned; of
30,000 freight cars, 28,950 were requisitioned; of 1,750 passenger
cars, 1,446 were requisitioned; of 300 electric trains, 215 were
requisitioned; of 37 Diesel-engine trains, 36 were requisitioned. In
general, the little material left by the Germans was badly damaged
either by wear and tear, by military operations, or by sabotage.
In addition to rolling stock, the Germans sent to the Reich considerable
quantities of rails, signals, cranes, turntables, repair cars,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(b) Tramways—the equipment was removed from The Hague
and Rotterdam to German cities. Thus, for example, some 50 tramcars
with motors and 42 trailers were sent to Bremen and Hamburg.
A considerable amount of rails, cables, and other accessories were
removed and transported to Germany. The motor buses of the
tramway companies were likewise taken by the occupying power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(c) The Germans seized the greater part of the motorcars, motorcycles,
and about 1 million bicycles. They left the population only
those machines which would not run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(d) Navigation—the Germans seized a considerable number of
barges and river boats, as well as a considerable part of the
merchant fleet, totalling about 1.5 million tons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(e) Postal equipment—the Germans seized a large quantity of
telephone and telegraph apparatus, cables, and other accessories,
which has not yet been computed; 600,000 radio sets were
confiscated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come to Chapter 49, miscellaneous spoliation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forced labor demanded by the occupier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From information given by the Netherlands Government, which
I submit as Document Number RF-135, a great number of Dutch
workers were obliged to work either in Holland or in Germany.
About 550,000 were deported to the Reich, which represents a
considerable number of hours of work lost to the national production
of the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Plunder of the royal palaces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The furniture, private archives, stable equipment and carriages,
and wine cellars of the royal house were plundered by the Germans.
In particular, the Palace of Noordeinde was completely
looted of its contents, including furniture, linen, silverware,
paintings, tapestries, art objects, and household utensils. A certain
number of similar objects were removed from the Palace of Het Loo
and were to be used in a convalescent home for German generals.
<span class='pageno' title='563' id='Page_563'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The archives of the royal family likewise were stolen. This is
shown by a report given by the representative of the Netherlands
Government, which I submit as Document Number RF-136.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pillage of the city of Arnhem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides numerous cases of individual looting, which are not
dealt with in this present statement, there was a systematically
organized pillage of entire cities. In this manner the town of
Arnhem was despoiled in October and November 1944. The
Germans brought in miners from Essen who, under military orders,
proceeded in specialized gangs to dismantle all the removable
furniture and send it and objects of all kinds to Germany. This
is shown in the testimony given by the representative of the Netherlands
Government, which I submit as Document Number RF-137.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The consequences of economic plundering in the Netherlands are
considerable. We shall just mention that the enormous decrease
of the national capital will result in production being below the
needs of the country for many years yet to come. But the gravest
consequence is that affecting the public health, which is irreparable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The excessive rationing, over many years, of food, clothing, and
fuel, ordered by the occupiers to increase the amount of spoliation,
has brought about an enfeeblement of the population. The average
calorie consumption by the inhabitant, which varied between 2,800
and 3,000, dropped in large proportions to about 1,800 calories,
finally to fall even to 400 calories in April 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Starting from the summer of 1944, the food situation became
more and more serious. The Reich Commissioner, Seyss-Inquart,
forbade the transport of foodstuffs between the western and
northern zones of the country. This measure, which was not
justified by any military operations, seems only to have been
dictated by hatred for the population, only to persecute and
intimidate them, to weaken and terrorize them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not until about December 1944 was this inhuman measure
lifted; but it was too late. Famine had already become general.
The death rate in the cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague,
Leyden, Delft and Gouda increased considerably, rising from 198
to 260 percent. Diseases which had almost been eliminated from
these regions reappeared. Such a situation will have irreparable
consequences for the future of the population. These facts are
given in two reports which I submit as Documents Numbers
RF-139 and 140.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By ordering such severe rationing measures in order to get for
themselves products which were indispensable to the existence of
the Netherlands, which is contrary to all principles of international
law, I may say that the German leaders committed one of their
gravest crimes.
<span class='pageno' title='564' id='Page_564'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>My statements concerning Holland are concluded. My colleague,
M. Delpech, will now state the case for Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. HENRY DELPECH (Assistant Prosecutor for the French
Republic): Mr. President, Gentlemen, I have the honor of presenting
to the Tribunal a statement on the economic plundering of Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As early as 1940 the National Socialist leaders intended to
invade Belgium, Holland, and northern France. They knew that
they should find there raw materials, equipment, and the factories
which would enable them to increase their war potential.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as Belgium had been occupied, the German military
administration did its best to reap the maximum benefit. To this
end the German leaders took a series of measures to block all
existing resources and to seize all means of payment. Important
supplies built up during the years 1936 to 1938 were the object
of enormous requisitions. The machines and equipment of
numerous enterprises were dismantled and sent to Germany,
bringing about the closing down of numerous factories and in many
sectors an enforced consolidation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Given the highly industrial character of this country, the occupying
authorities imposed, under threats of various kinds, a very
heavy tribute upon Belgian industries. Nor was agriculture spared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third part of the French economic exposé deals with a study
of all these measures. This will be the subject of four chapters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chapter 1 deals with the German seizure of the means of payment.
The second chapter will be devoted to clandestine purchases
and an account of the black market. Chapter 3 will deal with
purchases of apparent regularity while the fourth chapter will
concern impressment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a fifth chapter the acquisition of Belgian investments in
foreign concerns will be presented to the Tribunal, before concluding
and emphasizing the effect of the German intrusion on the
public health. Finally, a few remarks will be presented concerning
the conduct of the Germans after they had annexed the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chapter 1, German seizure of means of payment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To enslave the country from an economic point of view, the
most simple procedure was to secure the possession of the greater
part of the means of payment and to make impossible the export
of currency and valuables of all kinds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is an ordinance of 17 June 1940 which forbids the export
of currency and valuables of all kinds. This ordinance was published
in the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> for Belgium, Northern France, and Luxembourg
and will hereafter be called by its usual abbreviated form
VOBEL. This ordinance was published in VOBEL, Number 3, and
<span class='pageno' title='565' id='Page_565'></span>
was submitted under Document Number RF-99. In the VOBEL of
the same day appeared a notice dated 9 May 1940, which regulated
the issuing of Reichskreditkasse notes to provide the occupation
troops with legal tender. By this means the Germans made possible
the buying, without supplying any equivalent, all they desired in
a country abounding with products of all kinds, without the
inhabitants being able to protect their possessions against the
invader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The occupier used, in addition, three other methods for securing
the greater part of the means of payment. These three methods
were: The creation of an issuing bank, the imposition of war
tribute under the pretext of maintaining occupation troops, and the
working of a system of clearing to their profit alone. These
measures will be fully dealt with in three sections which now
follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Establishment of an issuing bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as they arrived in Belgium the Germans established an
office for supervising banks, which was entrusted at the same time
with the control of the National Bank of Belgium. This was ordered
on 14 June 1940—VOBEL, Number 2, which is submitted as Document
Number RF-141.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this time the directorate of the National Bank of Belgium was
outside the occupied territories; but the amount of notes on hand
would have been insufficient to insure normal circulation, as a great
number of Belgians had fled before the invasion, taking with them
a large quantity of paper money. These are, at least, the reasons
which the Germans put forward for establishing an issuing bank
by the ordinance of 27 June 1940, published in VOBEL, Numbers 4
and 5, which I submit as Document Number RF-142.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By virtue of this last ordinance, 27 June 1940, the new issuing
bank with a capital of 150 million Belgian francs, 20 percent of
which had been issued in coin, received the monopoly for issuing
paper money in Belgian francs. As a matter of fact, the National
Bank of Belgium no longer had the right to issue money. The
cover of the issuing bank was not represented by a gold balance
but: 1) by credits from discount operations and loans granted in
conformity with Article 8 of the new statutes; 2) monies owed to
the National Bank of Belgium, as well as coin which was in
circulation for the account of the public treasury; 3) finally, the
third means of cover—foreign currency and francs, particularly
German money, including Reichskreditkasse notes as well as assets
at the Reichsbank, at the Office of Compensation for the Reich, and
the Reichskreditkasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German Commissioner who had been appointed by a decree
of 26 June 1940 became the controller of the issuing bank—decree
<span class='pageno' title='566' id='Page_566'></span>
of 26 June 1940, published in VOBEL, Number 3, Page 88, and
submitted as Document Number RF-143.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the return to Belgium of the directors of the National
Bank, on 10 July 1940, an agreement between this bank and the
new issuing bank was effected by the nomination of the head of
the new issuing bank to the position of director of the National
Bank of Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The issuing bank proceeded to put out a large amount of notes,
so much so that on 8 May 1940 the currency in circulation amounted
to 29,800 million Belgian francs. On 29 December 1943 it amounted
to 83,200 million Belgian francs, and on 31 August 1944 it was
100,200 million Belgian francs, that is to say, an increase of 236
percent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The issuing bank functioned; but not without certain difficulties,
either with the military command, its own staff, or with the
National Bank of Belgium. Actually, besides its function of issuing,
the new bank had as a principal function operations relating to
postal orders and to currency, as well as operations with German
authorities, notably as concerned the occupation indemnity and,
above all, clearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The National Bank of Belgium lost its right to issue paper
money but resumed its traditional operations for private as well
as state accounts, particularly transactions on the open market.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These data, Gentlemen, are corroborated by the final report of
the German military administration in Belgium, ninth part, dealing
with currency and finance. This final report of the German military
administration in Belgium was discovered by the United States
Army, and it is a document to which we shall refer many times.
It is Document Number ECH-5 and is submitted to the Tribunal
as Exhibit Number RF-144.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ninth part, which is of interest here, was written by three
chiefs of the administration section of Brussels: Wetter, Hofrichter,
and Jost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of the establishment of the issuing bank, Reichskreditkasse
notes were valid in Belgium until August 1942; but it was
the National Bank of Belgium that was obliged to absorb these
notes in September 1944, and on account of this, Belgian economy
suffered a loss of 3,567 million Belgian francs. This number is given
by Wetter in the foregoing report, Page 112, the excerpt of the
report being submitted as Document Number RF-145.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, from information given by the Belgian Government,
the issuing bank had in hand at the moment of liberation of the
territory a sum totalling 644 million in Reichskreditkasse notes; and
further, it had assets in a transfer account of 12 million Reichsmark
on the books of the Reichskreditkasse, that is to say, a total loss
<span class='pageno' title='567' id='Page_567'></span>
of 656 million Belgian francs—the figure given in a report of the
Belgian Government, which is submitted as Document Number
RF-146.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Occupation costs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us now take the occupation costs. Article 49 of the Hague
Convention stipulates that if the occupier makes a levy in money,
it will be only for the needs of the army of occupation or for the
administration of the territory. The occupier can, therefore, impose
a tax for the maintenance of his army; but this must not exceed
the effective force strictly necessary. On the other hand, the words
“needs of the army of occupation” do not mean the expenses of
armament and equipment but solely the costs of billeting, food, and
normal pay, which excludes, in all cases, luxury expenses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, Article 52 authorizes the occupying authority to exact,
for the use of its army, requisitions in kind and in service on the
express condition that they shall be proportionate to the resources
of the country and that they should not involve the population
with the obligation to take part in military operations against their
own country. The same Article 52 stipulates, moreover, that levies
in kind will be, as far as possible, paid in cash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Consequently the Germans exacted a monthly indemnity of
1,000 million up to August 1941. On that date the indemnity was
increased to 1,500 million per month. By the end of August 1944,
the payments under that designation totaled 67,000 million Belgian
francs. This number cannot be contested by the Defense, since in
the report quoted, Pages 103 and following, the said Wetter wrote
in June 1944 that the total sum of Belgian francs paid for the army
of occupation was 64,181 million—the passage in the report is
submitted as Document Number RF-147.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this sum of 64,000 million was completely disproportionate
to the needs of the occupying army. This is shown in the report
of Wetter, in a passage which is submitted as Exhibit Number
RF-148. On Page 245 of this report it is said that on 17 January
1941 the general who was Commander-in-Chief in Belgium had
asked the High Command of the Army if the indemnity covered
only the expenses of occupation. This point of view was not
accepted by the commanding general, who, by order of 29 October
1941, specified that the indemnity of occupation was to be used not
only for the needs of the occupying army but also for those of the
operating armies. Moreover, on Page 11 of the original German
text of the same report it is written—and I shall read to the
Tribunal an excerpt which will be found in the document book
under Document Number RF-149, the second paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As the increase in the expenses of the Wehrmacht made it
clear that it would be impossible to manage with this amount,
<span class='pageno' title='568' id='Page_568'></span>
the military administration demanded that the calculation of
the occupation costs should be straightened out by deducting
all expenses foreign to the occupation proper. This concerned
especially the larger purchases of all kinds which the military
services made in Belgium, such as horses, motor vehicles,
equipment, all of which was designated for other territories
and was written off as occupation costs.</p>
<hr class='tbk706'/>
<p class='noindent'>“By a decision of the Delegate for the Four Year Plan, dated
11 June 1941, the financing of other than true occupation
costs was to be met by clearing. To comply with this decree,
beginning in July 1941, the administration of the military
commander ordered a monthly report to be rendered of all
expenses other than those required for the occupation but
which so far had been paid under the account of occupation
costs, in order to have these expenses refunded through
clearing. Thanks to this, large sums could be recovered and
put into the account of occupation costs.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Before concluding the examination of this point concerning war
tribute, that tribute called occupation costs, it is necessary to point
out that the Germans had already demanded, by the decree of
17 December 1940, submitted as Document Number RF-150, that
the costs of billeting their troops should be charged to Belgium.
Owing to this, the country had to meet expenses totalling 5,900
million francs, which went for billeting German troops, costs of
installation, supplies, and furniture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his report Wetter writes on Page 104—the excerpt submitted
as Document Number RF-147—that at the end of June 1944 the
Belgian payments for billeting troops totalled 5,423 million francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now come to the third part of German plundering—clearing.
The issuing of Reichskreditkasse notes and the war tribute, called
“occupation costs,” were not sufficient for Germany. Her leaders
created a system of clearing which enabled them to procure, unduly,
means of payment totalling 62,200 million Belgian francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as they arrived in Belgium, by the decrees of 10 July,
2 August, and 5 December, 1940—which appear in the document
book under the Numbers RF-151, RF-152, and RF-153—the Germans
specified:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1) That all payments on debts of people resident in Belgium to
their creditors in Germany had to be paid into an account called
the “Deutsche Verrechnungskasse, Berlin.” This was an open
account on the books of the National Bank of Belgium in Brussels,
an account kept in belgas in spite of the prohibition on currency
of 17 June 1940, the prohibition to which I have already referred
concerning the blocking of means of payment in the country.
<span class='pageno' title='569' id='Page_569'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>By the decision of 4 August 1940, it was moreover prescribed
that the carrying out of clearing would henceforth no longer be
entrusted to the National Bank of Belgium but to the issuing bank
in Brussels, which, as I have already had the honor of pointing out,
had been established by the occupying power and was under their
absolute control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2) The Germans laid down a second measure whereby all
debtors resident in the Reich should pay their Belgian creditors by
way of the open account at the issuing bank in Brussels, at the
following rate of exchange; 100 belgas to 40 marks, that is to say,
1 mark for 12.50 Belgian francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These arrangements, moreover, were extended to the countries
occupied by Germany with a view to facilitating their operations
in those countries; they were even extended to certain neutral
countries by various similar decrees appearing in the ordinance book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mission of the issuing bank in Brussels consisted, therefore,
on the one hand, of receiving payments from all persons or agencies
established in Belgium which had foreign engagements and, on the
other hand, to pay those persons or agencies established in Belgium
which had foreign credit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In other words, every time an exporter delivered goods to an
importer of another country which belonged to the clearing system,
it was the issuing bank which settled the invoice and which entered
as equivalent, in the ledgers, a corresponding credit at the Deutsche
Verrechnungskasse in Berlin—the German Clearing Institute in
Berlin. In the case of imports, the inverse procedure was followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fact, under the German direction, this system functioned to
the detriment of the Belgian community which, at the moment of
the liberation, was creditor in clearing to the extent of 62,665
million Belgian francs. It was the National Bank of Belgium
which had been forced to make advances to the issuing bank to
balance the account of the German Clearing Institute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A large number of operations made through clearing had no
commercial character whatever but were purely and simply
military and political expenses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From information given by the Belgian Government, the
clearing operations could be summarized in the following manner—and
I take the figures from a report of the Belgian Government
previously cited, which has been presented as Document Number
RF-146: Of the total transactions, 93 percent were Belgium-German
clearing operations; merchandise amounted to 93 percent, and
services 91 percent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If one considers the part taken respectively by merchandise,
services, or capital, one obtains a very significant picture. The
<span class='pageno' title='570' id='Page_570'></span>
entire clearing transactions of Belgium with foreign countries
totalled, on 2 September 1944, the sum of 61,636 million Belgian
francs, of which 57,298 million were for Belgium-German operations,
4,000 million only with France, 1,000 million with the Netherlands,
and 929 million with other countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is only in the sector of goods and services that the want of
equilibrium is apparent due in large measure to requisitions of
property and services made by Germany for her own account. It is
known that the so-called exports affected especially metals and
metal products, machines, and textile products, nine-tenths of which
were seized by the Reich, which made itself thereby guilty of real
spoliation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the transfer of capital, during the first period of the
occupation it was particularly intense. It concerned the forced
realization of Belgian capital in foreign countries, as well as the
forced cession to German groups of Belgian assets blocked in
Germany. No effective compensation was given in exchange. The
transfers made for services were principally for payments for
Belgian labor in foreign countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The credit balance of these services on 2 September 1944 is as
follows, in Belgian francs: Total clearing operations dealing with
services, 20,016 million—that is to say, for payment of labor
73 percent of the total. For Germany alone, 18,227 million—that
is, 72 percent of the total amount. For France only 1,621 million
Belgian francs—that is to say, a very small part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not content with requisitioning workers for forced labor in
Germany or in the occupied territories, the Germans compelled
Belgium to bear the financial burden and imposed it either through
the liquidation of the transferred savings in clearing or by the
remittance of Belgian notes to the Directorate of the Reich Bank
in Berlin for payment of workers in national currency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you think it is necessary to go into these
clearing operations again? In each case of the various countries
which have been dealt with, the same clearing operations have
taken place, have they not? Then perhaps it is really unnecessary
to do it over again for Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DELPECH: Very well, Your Honor. At all events, the
Germans recognized the fact, and the figures taken from the report
previously cited support the conclusions of our statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before ending this chapter concerning German seizure of the
means of payment, it is fitting that the attention of the Tribunal
be brought to the order of 22 July 1940, by which the Germans
fixed the rate of the Belgian franc at 8 Reichspfennig, that is to
say 12.50 francs per mark; and in the forementioned report Wetter
<span class='pageno' title='571' id='Page_571'></span>
writes concerning this matter, on Pages 37 and 38, a passage which
I ask the Tribunal’s permission to read and which is in the document
book as Document Number RF-158.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The <span class='it'>de facto</span> maintenance of the pre-war parity was moreover
of considerable political importance because a large
group of the population would have considered a sharp
devaluation or a repeated change of parity as a maneuver of
exploitation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The following observation in connection with this conception
must be made: The occupiers had no need in Belgium to decree,
with the view of promoting their economic exploitation, that the
Belgian franc should have a lesser value when, as a matter of fact—contrary
to what occurred in France—they had, at the moment
they entered Belgium, instituted new currency over which they
had the control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lastly, let us mention that Germany obliged the Vichy Government
to deliver 221,730 kilos of gold amounting, at the 1939 value,
to 9,500 million francs; but as France had returned this gold to
the Bank of Belgium, this question will be treated under the
economic exploitation of France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Recapitulation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To sum up, the means of payment seized by the army of
occupation may be seen from the following figures:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reichskreditkasse notes, 3,567 million; various bills and accounts
on the books of the Reichskreditkasse, 656 million; war tribute
under the pretext of occupation costs, 67,000 million; to which may
be added the credit balance of clearing 62,665 million; total (in
Belgian francs), 133,888 million.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans thus seized no less than 130,000 million Belgian
francs, which they used for outwardly regular purchases, for payment
of their requisitions, and to make clandestine purchases on
the black market. These so-called purchases and requisitions will
be treated in the following chapters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chapter 2, clandestine purchases, black market.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As in all the other occupied territories, the Germans organized
a black market in Belgium as early as October 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to a secret report on the black market, called “Final
Report of the Control Office of the Military Commander in Belgium
and in the North of France, Concerning the Legalized Emptying
of the Black Market in Belgium and in the North of France,” a
report covering the period from 13 March 1942 to 31 May 1943—Exhibit
Number RF-159 (Document Number ECH-7) in the document
book—the reasons given by the Germans for this organization
of the black market are three in number:
<span class='pageno' title='572' id='Page_572'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>1) To check competition on the black market between various
German buyers; 2) to make the best use of the Belgian resources
for the purposes of German war economy; 3) to do away with the
pressure exercised on the general standard of prices and by this
to avoid all danger of inflation which would result in endangering
German currency itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This same report tells us, Pages 3 and following, that an actual
administrative organization was set up by the Germans for carrying
out this policy. The bookkeeping was done by the Clearing
Institute of the Wehrmacht, which combined all the operations in
its books. The direction of purchases was regulated by a central
organization, the name of which changed as the years went by and
which had a certain number of organizations subordinate to it,
particularly a whole series of purchasing offices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The central organization was set up in accordance with the
decree of the military commander in Belgium, dated 20 February
1942. It was formed on the 13th of the following March; and as
soon as it was created it received special directives from the
delegate of the Reich Marshal, Defendant Göring. This delegate
was Lieutenant Colonel Veltjens, of whom we spoke this morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This organization was only established to co-ordinate the
legalization and direction of the black market, as had been determined
upon, and planned following conferences between the Commissioner
General and the Military Commander of Belgium with
the Chief of the Armament Inspection. According to the terms of
that agreement, which reinforced a declaration of 16 February 1942
emanating from the Reich Minister for Economics, the aim was to
drain the black market and in accordance with directives, in a
legal form, with the main idea of safeguarding the supply requirements
of the German Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This organization had its offices in Brussels. The purchases
themselves were regulated by a certain number of specialized
offices, the list of which is given on Page 5 of the forementioned
report. These organisms received their orders from the Rohstoffhandelsgesellschaft,
which has already been mentioned at the
beginning of the statement on the economic exploitation of Western
Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The role of Roges was very important in the organization of the
black market. In effect it was four-fold:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1) The purchasing directives, once the authorization had been
given by the central office in Brussels, were transmitted by Roges
to the proper purchasing office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2) The delivery of goods bought and marked for the Reich were
made through Roges which took charge of their distribution in
Germany. Pg578
<span class='pageno' title='573' id='Page_573'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>3) Roges financed the operations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4) It was Roges which was entrusted with paying the difference
between the rate of purchase—generally very high because of the
black market rate—and the fixed official rate of sale on the German
domestic market. The difference was covered by an equalizing
fund, supplied from the occupation costs account, to which the
Reich Minister of Finance put sums at the disposal of Roges
through the channel of the Ministry of Armament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The forementioned report furnishes a complete series of interesting
particulars on the functioning of the central organization
itself. It is interesting to note that the central office in Brussels
was instructed by order of the Military Commander in Belgium,
dated 3 November 1942, to have a branch at Lille set up for the
north of France. At the same time, the Brussels office was
authorized to instruct its branch office at Lille. In the document
book, under Document Number RF-160, a final report of the Lille
office is mentioned. This report, drawn up on 20 May 1943, gives
a whole series of interesting particulars on the functioning of this
organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is 5 o’clock now. M. Delpech, I think it
would be the wish of the Tribunal, if it were possible, for you to
omit any parts of this document which are on precisely the same
principles with those which have already been submitted to us in
connection with the other countries. If you could, I think that
would be convenient for the Tribunal. Of course, if there are any
essential differences in the treatment of Belgium then, no doubt,
you would draw our attention to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DELPECH: Certainly, Your Honor.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
